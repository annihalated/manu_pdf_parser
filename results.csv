","Direct Taxation - Constitutional validity - Quoting of Aadhaar number -

Act is discriminatory and offends Article 14 - Whether impugned provision is
violative of Article 19(1)(g) - Whether restrictions which would result in
terms of proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 139AA of Act, 1961 are
reasonable or not

Facts:

Section 139AA of the Income Tax Act, 1961 has been inserted by the
amendment to the said Act vide Finance Act, 2017. As per the Section 139AA,
well as in the income-tax returns, the Assessee was obliged to quote Aadhaar
number. This was necessitated on any such applications for PAN or return of
income on or after July 01, 2017, which meant from that date quoting of
Aadhaar number became essential. Proviso to Sub-section (1) gives relaxation
from quoting Aadhaar number to those persons who do not possess Aadhaar
number but have already applied for issuance of Aadhaar card. In their cases,
the Enrolment ID of Aadhaar application form was to be quoted. It would
mean that those who would not be possessing Aadhaar card as on July 01,
2017 may have to necessarily apply for enrolment of Aadhaar before July 01,




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 71) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University2017. The effect of this provision was that every person who desires to obtain
PAN card or who is an Assessee has to necessarily enrol for Aadhaar. It made
obtaining of Aadhaar card compulsory for those persons who are income-tax
Assessees. Proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 139AA of the Act stipulates
the consequences of failure to intimate the Aadhaar number. In those cases,
PAN allotted to such persons would become invalid not only from July 01,
2017, but from its inception as the deeming provision in this proviso mentions
that PAN would be invalid as if the person had not applied for allotment of
PAN, i.e. from the very beginning. Sub-section (3), however, gives discretion
to the Central Government to exempt such person or class or classes of
persons or any State or part of any State from the requirement of quoting
Aadhaar number in the application form for PAN or in the return of income.
Hence, the present petitions filed by the Petitioners, who claimed themselves
to be public spirited persons, challenge was laid to the constitutional validity
of Section 139AA of the Act, 1961.

According to the Petitioners, though Aadhaar Act prescribes that enrolment
under the Act is voluntary and gives choice to a person to enrol or not to enrol
himself and obtain Aadhaar card, this compulsive element thrusted in Section
139AA of the Act makes the said provision unconstitutional. The Petitioners
submitted that Petitioners would not be pitching their case on the 'Right to
Privacy' and would be questioning the validity of Section 139AA of the Act
primarily on Articles 14 and 19 of the Constitution.
Held, while disposing off the petitions:

(i) Challenge to Aadhaar scheme/legislation on the ground that it was
violative of Article 21 of the Constitution was pending before the Constitution
Bench and, therefore, the present Bench could not have decided that issue.
Since the Supreme Court and the High Courts are treated as the 'ultimate
arbiter in all matters involving interpretation of the Constitution, it is the
Courts which have the final say on questions relating to rights and whether
such a right is violated or not. [71] and[73]

(ii) In exercise of power of judicial review, Indian Courts are invested with
powers to strike down primary legislation enacted by the Parliament or the
State legislatures. However, while undertaking this exercise of judicial
review, the same is to be done at three levels. In the first stage, the Court
would examine as to whether impugned provision in a legislation is
compatible with the fundamental rights or the Constitutional provisions
(substantive judicial review) or it falls foul of the federal distribution of
powers (procedural judicial review). If it is not found to be so, no further
exercise is needed as challenge would fail. On the other hand, if it is found
that Legislature lacks competence as the subject legislated was not within
the powers assigned in the list in VII Schedule, no further enquiry is needed
and such a law is to be declared as ultra vires the Constitution. However,
while undertaking substantive judicial review, if it is found that the impugned
provision appears to be violative of fundamental rights or other Constitutional
rights, the Court reaches the second stage of review. At this second phase of
enquiry, the Court is supposed to undertake the exercise as to whether the
impugned provision can still be saved by reading it down so as to bring it in
conformity with the Constitutional provisions. If that is not achievable then




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 71) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universitythe enquiry enters the third stage. If the offending portion of the statute is
severable, it is severed and the Court strikes down the impugned provision
declaring the same as unconstitutional. [80]

(iii) When it comes to exercising the power of judicial review of a legislation,
the scope of such a power has to be kept in mind and the power is to be
exercised within the limited sphere assigned to the judiciary to undertake the
judicial review. Unless the Petitioner demonstrated that the Parliament, in
enacting the impugned provision, had exceeded its power prescribed in the
Constitution or this provision violates any of the provision, the argument
predicated on 'limited governance' will not succeed. One of the ingredients
needed to be established by the Petitioners in order to succeed. [85]

(iv) The Aadhaar Act is enacted to enable the Government to identify
individuals for delivery of benefits, subsidies and services under various
welfare schemes. As per the Government and UIDAI itself, the requirement of
obtaining Aadhaar number is voluntary. It has been so claimed by UIDAI on
its website and clarification to this effect has also been issued by UIDAI.
Thus, enrolment under Aadhaar was voluntary. [90] and[91]

(v) On the one hand, enrollment under Aadhaar card was voluntary, however,
for the purposes of Income Tax Act, 1961, Section 139AA makes it compulsory
for the Assessees to give Aadhaar number which means insofar as income tax
the Aadhaar Act and obtain Aadhaar number which will be their identification
number as that has become the requirement under the Income Tax Act, 1961.
[92]

(vi) A harmonious reading of the two enactments, the Aadhaar Act and the
Income Tax Act, 1961 would clearly suggests that whereas enrollment of
Aadhaar is voluntary when it comes to taking benefits of various welfare
schemes even if it is presumed that requirement of Section 7 of Aadhaar Act
that it is necessary to provide Aadhaar number to avail the benefits of
schemes and services, it is upto a person to avail those benefits or not. On the
other hand, purpose behind enacting Section 139AA is to check a menace of
black money as well as money laundering and also to widen the income tax
net so as to cover those persons who are evading the payment of tax. [93]

(vii) Article 14 in its ambit and sweep involves two facets, viz., it permits
reasonable classification which is founded on intelligible differentia and
accommodates the practical needs of the society and the differential must
have a rational relation to the objects sought to be achieved. Further, it does
not allow any kind of arbitrariness and ensures fairness and equality of
treatment. It is the fonjuris of our Constitution, the fountainhead of justice.
Differential treatment does not per se amount to violation of Article 14 of the
Constitution and it violates Article 14 only when there is no reasonable basis
and there are several tests to decide whether a classification is reasonable or
not and one of the tests will be as to whether it is conducive to the
functioning of modern society. It could not be said that there was no nexus
with the objective sought to be achieved. [96] and[100]

(viii) The principle of equality does not mean that every law must have




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 71) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universityuniversal application for all persons who are not by nature, attainment or
circumstances, in the same position, as the varying needs of different classes
of persons often require separate treatment. It is permissible for the State to
classify persons for legitimate purposes. The Legislature is also competent to
exercise its discretion and make classification. In the present scenario the
impugned legislation has created two classes, i.e. one class of those persons
who are Assessees and other class of those persons who are income tax
Assessees. It is because of the reason that the impugned provision is
applicable only to those who are filing income tax returns. Therefore, the only
question would be as to whether this classification is reasonable or not. There
cannot be any dispute that there is a reasonable basis for differentiation and,
therefore, equal protection Clause enshrined in Article 14 is not attracted.
What Article 14 prohibits is class legislation and not reasonable classification
for the purpose of legislation. All income tax assessees constitute one class
and they are treated alike by the impugned provision. [103]

(ix) If the PAN of a person is withdrawn or is nullified, it definitely amounts
to placing restrictions on the right to do business as a business Under Article
19(1)(g) of the Act. The provision is aimed at seeding Aadhaar with PAN. One
of the main objectives is to de-duplicate PAN cards and to bring a situation
where one person is not having more than one PAN card or a person is not
able to get PAN cards in assumed/fictitious names. In such a scenario, if
those persons who violate        Section 139AA     of the    Act without any
of the Legislature to make penal provisions for violation of any law made bye
it. In the instant case, requirement of giving Aadhaar enrolment number to
the designated authority or stating this number in the income tax returns is
directly connected with the issue of duplicate/fake PANs. [115] and[122]

(x) Those who were not PAN holders, while applying for PAN, they were
required to give Aadhaar number. This is the stipulation of Sub-section (1) of
Section 139AA. At the same time, as far as existing PAN holders were
concerned, since the impugned provisions qwre yet to be considered on the
touchstone of Article 21 of the Constitution, including on the debate around
Right to Privacy and human dignity, etc. as limbs of Article 21, till the aspect
of Article 21 is decided by the Constitution Bench a partial stay of the
aforesaid proviso is necessary. Those who had already enrolled themselves
under Aadhaar scheme would comply with the requirement of Sub-section (2)
of Section 139AA of the Act. Those who still want to enrol are free to do so.
However, those Assessees who were not Aadhaar card holders and did not
comply with the provision of Section 139(2), their PAN cards be not treated as
invalid for the time being. It was only to facilitate other transactions which
were mentioned in Rule 114B of the Rules. A person who is holder of PAN and
if his PAN is invalidated, he is bound to suffer immensely in his day to day
dealings, which situation should be avoided till the Constitution Bench
authoritatively determines the argument of Article 21 of the Constitution. It
would be permissible for the Parliament to consider as to whether there is a
need to tone down the effect of the said proviso by limiting the consequences.
Proviso to Section 139AA(2) cannot be read retrospectively. If failure to
intimate the Aadhaar number renders PAN void ab initio with the deeming
provision that the PAN allotted would be invalid as if the person had not
applied for allotment of PAN would have rippling effect of unsettling settled




     08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 71) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityrights of the parties. It had the effect of undoing all the acts done by a person
on the basis of such a PAN. It may have even the effect of incurring other
penal consequences under the Act for earlier period on the ground that there
was no PAN registration by a particular Assessee. The rights which are
already accrued to a person in law cannot be taken away. Therefore, this
provision needs to be read down by making it clear that it would operate
prospectively. [125] and[126]

(xi) A large Section of citizens feel concerned about possible data leak, even
when many of those support linkage of PAN with Aadhaar. This was a concern
which needed to be addressed by the Government. It was important that the
apprehensions are assuaged by taking proper measures so that confidence is
instilled among the public at large that there is no chance of unauthorised
leakage of data whether it is done by tightening the operations of the
contractors who are given the job of enrollment, they being private persons or
by prescribing severe penalties to those who are found guilty of leaking the
details, is the outlook of the Government. However, measures in this behalf
are absolutely essential and it would be in the fitness of things that proper
scheme in this behalf is devised at the earliest. [127]

(xii) The Parliament was fully competent to enact Section 139AA of the Act
and its authority to make this law was not diluted by the orders of the
present Court. There was no conflict between the provisions of Aadhaar Act
harmoniously, they operate in distinct fields. Section 139AA of the Act is not
discriminatory nor it offends equality Clause enshrined in Article 14 of the
Constitution. Section 139AA is also not violative of Article 19(1)(g) of the
Constitution insofar as it mandates giving of Aadhaar enrollment number for
applying PAN cards in the income tax returns or notified Aadhaar enrollment
number to the designated authorities. Further, proviso to Sub-section (2)
thereof has to be read down to mean that it would operate only prospective.
The validity of the provision upheld is subject to passing the muster of Article
21 of the Constitution, which was the issue before the Constitution Bench.
Till then, there shall remain a partial stay on the operation of proviso to Sub-
section (2) of Section 139AA of the Act. [128]

    the Official Gazette:

        Provided that in case of failure to intimate the Aadhaar number, the
        permanent account number allotted to the person shall be deemed to

    (3) The provisions of this Section shall not apply to such person or class or
    classes of persons or any State or part of any State, as may be notified by the

forms for allotment of Permanent Account Number (for short, 'PAN') as well as in the
income-tax returns, the Assessee is obliged to quote Aadhaar number. This is
necessitated on any such applications for PAN or return of income on or after July 01,
2017, which means from that date quoting of Aadhaar number for the aforesaid
purposes becomes essential. Proviso to Sub-section (1) gives relaxation from quoting
Aadhaar number to those persons who do not possess Aadhaar number but have already
applied for issuance of Aadhaar card. In their cases, the Enrolment ID of Aadhaar
application form is to be quoted. It would mean that those who would not be
possessing Aadhaar card as on July 01, 2017 may have to necessarily apply for
enrolment of Aadhaar before July 01, 2017.

3. The effect of this provision, thus, is that every person who desires to obtain PAN card
or who is an Assessee has to necessarily enrol for Aadhaar. It makes obtaining of
Aadhaar card compulsory for those persons who are income-tax Assessees. Proviso to
Sub-section (2) of Section 139AA of the Act stipulates the consequences of failure to
intimate the Aadhaar number. In those cases, PAN allotted to such persons would
become invalid not only from July 01, 2017, but from its inception as the deeming
provision in this proviso mentions that PAN would be invalid as if the person had not
applied for allotment of PAN, i.e. from the very beginning. Sub-section (3), however,
gives discretion to the Central Government to exempt such person or class or classes of
number in the application form for PAN or in the return of income.quoting Aadhaar




      08-08-2022 (Page 6 of 71)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityThe challenge is to this compulsive nature of provision inasmuch as with the
introduction of the aforesaid provision, no discretion is left with the income-tax
Assessees insofar as enrolment under the Aadhaar (Targeting Delivery of Financial and
Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the
'Aadhaar Act') is concerned. According to the Petitioners, though Aadhaar Act prescribes
that enrolment under the said Act is voluntary and gives choice to a person to enrol or
not to enrol himself and obtain Aadhaar card, this compulsive element thrusted in
Section 139AA of the Act makes the said provision unconstitutional. The basis on which
the Petitioners so contend would be taken note of at the appropriate stage. Purpose of
these introductory remarks was to highlight the issue involved in these writ petitions at
the threshold.

4. Before we take note of the arguments advanced by the Petitioners and the rebuttal
thereof by the Respondents, it would be in the fitness of things to take stock of
historical facts pertaining to the Aadhaar scheme and what Aadhaar enrolment amounts
to.
Aadhaar Scheme and its administrative and statutory framework

5 . Respondent No. 1, Union of India, through the Planning Commission, issued
Notification dated January 28, 2009, constituting the Unique Identification Authority of
India (for short, 'UIDAI') for the purpose of implementing of Unique Identity (UID)
scheme wherein a UID database was to be collected from the residents of India.
Pursuant to the said Notification, the Government of India appointed Shri Nandan
Nilekhani, an entrepreneur, as the Chairman of the UIDAI on July 02, 2009. According
to this scheme, every citizen of India is entitled to enrol herself/himself with it and get
a unique, randomly selected 12 digit number. For such enrolment, every person so
intending would have to provide his/her personal information along with biometric
details such a fingerprints and iris scan for future identification. Accordingly, it is
intended to create a centralized database under the UIDAI with all the above
information. The scheme was launched in September 2010 in the rural areas of
Maharashtra and thereafter extended all over India. One of the objects of the entire
project was non-duplication and elimination of fake identity cards.
6. On December 03, 2010, the National Identification Authority of India Bill, 2010 was
introduced in the Rajya Sabha. On December 13, 2011, the Standing Committee Report
was submitted to the Parliament stating that both the Bill and project should be re-
considered. The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance rejected the Bill of 2010
as there was opposition to the passing of the aforesaid Bill by the Parliament. Be that as
it may, the said Bill of 2010 did not get through. The result was that as on that date,
Aadhaar Scheme was not having any statutory backing but was launched and continued
to operate in exercise of executive power of the Government. It may also be mentioned
that the Government appointed private enrollers and these private collection/enrolment
centres run by private parties continued to enrol the citizens under the UID scheme.

7. Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012, Under Article 32 of the Constitution of India,
was preferred by Justice K.S. Puttuswamy, a former Judge of the Karnataka High Court
before this Court, challenging the UID scheme stating therein that the same does not
have any statutory basis and it violated the 'Right to Privacy', which is a facet of Article
21 of the Constitution. This Court decided to consider the plea raised in the said writ
petition and issued notice. Vide order dated September 23, 2013, the Court also passed
the following directions:





      08-08-2022 (Page 7 of 71)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University    In the meanwhile, no person should suffer for not getting the Aadhaar card in
    spite of the fact that some authority had issued a circular making it mandatory
    and when any person applies to get the Aadhaar Card voluntarily, it may be
    checked whether that person is entitled for it under the law and it should not be
    given to any illegal immigrant.

In the meanwhile, various writ petitions were filed by public spirited citizens and
organisations challenging the validity of the Aadhaar scheme and this Court has tagged
all those petitions along with Writ Petition (Civil) No. 494 of 2012.

Court passed orders requiring UIDAI to provide biometric information to CBI forHigh
investigation purposes with respect to a criminal trial. This order was challenged by
UIDAI by filing Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 2524 of 2014, in which orders
dated March 24, 2014 were passed by this Court restraining the UIDAI from transferring
any biometric information to any agency without the written consent of the concerned
individual. The said order is in the following terms:

    In the meanwhile, the present Petitioner is restrained from transferring any
    biometric information of any person who has been allotted the Aadhaar number
    to any other agency without his consent in writing.

    More so, no person shall be deprived of any service for want of Aadhaar
    number in case he/she is otherwise eligible/entitled. All the authorities are
    directed to modify their forms/circulars/likes so as to not compulsorily require
    the Aadhaar number in order to meet the requirement of the interim order
    passed by this Court forthwith.
9 . Thereafter, the aforesaid writ petitions and special leave petitions were taken up
together. Matter was heard at length by a three Judges Bench of this Court and detailed
arguments were advanced by various counsel appearing for the Petitioners as well as
the Attorney General for India who appeared on behalf of the Union of India. As stated
above, one of the main grounds of attack on Aadhaar Card scheme was that the very
collection of biometric data is violative of the 'Right to Privacy', which, in turn, violated
not only Article 21 of the Constitution of India but other Articles embodying the
fundamental rights guaranteed under Part III of the Constitution. This argument was
sought to be rebutted by the Respondents with the submission that in view of eight
Judges' Bench judgment of this Court inM.P. Sharma and Ors. v. Satish Chandra
and Ors. MANU/SC/0018/1954 : AIR 1954 SC 300 and that of six Judges' Bench in
Kharak Singh v. State of U.P. and Ors. MANU/SC/0085/1962 : AIR 1963 SC 1295,
the legal position regarding the existence of fundamental Right to Privacy is doubtful. At
the same time, it was also accepted that subsequently smaller Benches of two or three
Judges of this Court had given the judgments recognising the Right to Privacy as part of
Article 21 of the Constitution. On that basis, Respondents submitted that the matters
were required to be heard by a Larger Bench to debate important questions like:

    (i) Whether there is any Right to Privacy guaranteed under the Constitution;
    and

    (ii) If such a Right exists, what is the source and what are the contours of such
    Right to Privacy.is no express provision in the Constitution adumbrating the

10. Though, this suggestion of the Respondents were opposed by the counsel for the




      08-08-2022 (Page 8 of 71)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityPetitioners, the said Bench still deemed it proper to refer the matter to the Larger Bench
and the reasons for taking this course of action are mentioned in paras 12 and 13 of the
order dated August 11, 2015 which reads as under:

    12. We are of the opinion that the cases on hand raise far reaching questions
    of importance involving interpretation of the Constitution. What is at stake is
    the amplitude of the fundamental rights including that precious and inalienable
    right Under Article 21. If the observations made inM.P. Sharma (supra) and
    Kharak Singh (supra) are to be read literally and accepted as the law of this
    country, the fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India and
    more particularly right to liberty Under Article 21 would be denuded of vigour
    and vitality. At the same time, we are also of the opinion that the institutional
    integrity and judicial discipline require that pronouncement made by larger
    Benches of this Court cannot be ignored by the smaller Benches without
    appropriately explaining the reasons for not following the pronouncements
    made by such larger Benches. With due respect to all the learned Judges who
    referred to their Lordships concern for the liberty of human beings, we are of
    the humble opinion that there appears to be certain amount of apparent
    unresolved contradiction in the law declared by this Court.

    13. Therefore, in our opinion to give a quietus to the kind of controversy raised
    in this batch of cases once for all, it is better that ratio decidendi of M.P.
    Sharma (supra) and Kharak Singh (supra) is scrutinized and the jurisprudential
    correctness of the subsequent decisions of this Court where the right to privacy
    is either asserted or referred be examined and authoritatively decided by a
    Bench of appropriate strength.

11. While referring the matter as aforesaid, by another order of the even date, the
Bench expressed that it would be desirable that the matter be heard at the earliest. On
the same day, yet another order was passed by the Bench in those petitions giving
certain interim directions which would prevail till the matter is finally decided by the
Larger Bench. We would like to reproduce this order containing the said interim
arrangement in toto:

Facts:

The Petitioner was a registered society engaged in taking of the common
problems of the people. The present petition was filed to bring to the notice of
this Court the serious problem of violation of fundamental right to life, liberty,
privacy and the right to die with dignity of the people of this country,
guaranteed to them under Article 21 of the Constitution. It was submitted that
the people who are suffering from chronic diseases and are at the end of their
natural life span are deprived of their rights to refuse cruel and unwanted
medical treatment, like feeding through hydration tubes, being kept on
ventilator and other life supporting machines in order to artificially prolong
their natural life span. It was further pleaded that it was a common law right
of the people, of any civilized country, to refuse unwanted medical treatment
and no person could force him/her to take any medical treatment which the
person did not desire to continue with.

Held, while allowing petition:



Dipak Misra, C.J.I. and A.M. Khanwilkar, J.





     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 217)  www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University(i) The present Court noted that a careful and precise perusal of the judgment
in Gian Kaur v. State of Punjab reflects the right of a dying man to die with
dignity when life is ebbing out, and in the case of a terminally ill patient,
where there is no hope of recovery, accelerating the process of death for
reducing the period of suffering constitutes a right to live with dignity.
Common law jurisdictions reveal that all adults with capacity to consent have
the right of self-determination and autonomy. The said rights pave the way for
the right to refuse medical treatment which had acclaimed universal
recognition. A competent person who had come of age has the right to refuse
specific treatment or all treatment or opt for an alternative treatment, even if
such decision entails a risk of death. The 'Emergency Principle' or the 'Principle
of Necessity' has to be given effect to only when it is not practicable to obtain
the patient's consent for treatment and his/her life is in danger. But where a
patient has already made a valid Advance Directive which is free from
reasonable doubt and specifying that he/she does not wish to be treated, then
such directive had to be given effect to. Right to life and liberty as envisaged
under Article 21 of the Constitution is meaningless unless it encompasses
within its sphere individual dignity. The present Court noted that with the
passage of time, this Court has expanded the spectrum of Article 21 to include
within it the right to live with dignity as component of right to life and liberty.
[195 ]



A.K. Sikri, J. :Concurring View

(ii) We do not cut short the sufferings of our ailing dear ones by death
because, as a rule, we have always means at our disposal to help them and
they have the capacity to think and decide for themselves. But supposing that
and the patient is lying in an unconscious state in the throes of agony, thention
there would be no hinsa in putting an end to his suffering by death. Just as a
surgeon did not commit hinsa but practices the purest ahinsa when he wields
his knife, one may find it necessary, under certain imperative circumstances, to
go a step further and sever life from the body in the interest of the sufferer. It
may be objected that whereas the surgeon performs his operation to save the
life of the patient, in the other case we did just the reverse. But on a deeper
analysis it would be found that the ultimate object sought to be served in both
the cases is the same, namely, to relieve the suffering soul within from pain.
The present Court concluded that to cause pain or wish ill to or to take the life
of any living being out of anger or a selfish intent, is hinsa. On the other hand,
after a calm and clear judgment to kill or cause pain to a living being from a
pure selfless intent may be the purest form of ahinsa. [247 ]

(iii) Advance directives are instruments through which persons express their
wishes at a prior point in time, when they are capable of making an informed
decision, regarding their medical treatment in the future, when they are not in
a position to make an informed decision, by reason of being unconscious or in
a persistent vegetative state (PVS) or in a coma. A medical power of attorney
is an instrument through which persons nominate representatives to make
decisions regarding their medical treatment at a point in time when the
persons executing the instrument are unable to make informed decisions
themselves. The one hand autonomy of an individual gives him right to choose




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 217) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityhis destiny and, therefore, he may decide before hand, in the form of advance
directive, at what stage of his physical condition he would not like to have
medical treatment, and on the other hand, there are dangers of misuse thereof
as well. The possibility of misuse could not be held to be a valid ground for
rejecting advance directive, as opined by the Law Commission of India as well
in its 196 th and 241  stReport. Instead, attempt could be made to provide
safeguards for exercise of such advance directive. [327],[328] and[329]



Dr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :Concurring View

(iv) The reason which had impelled the Court to recognize passive euthanasia
and advance directives is that both bear a close association to the human urge
to live with dignity. Age brings isolation. Physical and mental debility bring a
loss of self worth. Pain and suffering are accompanied by a sense of being
helpless. The loss of control is compounded when medical intervention takes
over life. Human values are then lost to technology. More significant than the
affliction of ageing and disease is the fear of our human persona being lost in
the anonymity of an intensive care ward. It is hence necessary for this Court to
recognize that our dignity as citizens continues to be safeguarded by the
Constitution even when life is seemingly lost and questions about our own
mortality confront us in the twilight of existence. The sanctity of human life is
the arterial vein which animates the values, spirit and cellular structure of the
Constitution. The Constitution recognizes the value of life as its indestructible
component. The survival of the sanctity principle is founded upon the
guarantees of dignity, autonomy and liberty. Constitutional recognition of the
dignity of existence as an inseparable element of the right to life necessarily
means that dignity attaches throughout the life of the individual. Dignity of life
must encompass dignity in the stages of living which lead up to the end of life.
Dignity in the process of dying is as much a part of the right to life under
Article 21 of the Constitution. To deprive an individual of dignity towards the
end of life is to deprive the individual of a meaningful existence. Hence, the
Constitution protects the legitimate expectation of every person to lead a life
of dignity until death occurs. The constitutionally recognized right to life is
subject to the procedure established by law. The procedure for Regulation or
deprivation must, it is well-settled, be fair, just and reasonable. [477 ]


Ashok Bhushan, J. :Concurring View

(v) The rights of bodily integrity and self-determination are the rights which
belong to every human being. When an adult person having mental capacity to
take a decision can exercise his right not to take treatment or withdraw from
treatment, the above right could not be negated for a person who is not able to
take an informed decision due to terminal illness or being a PVS. In case of a
person who is suffering from a disease and is taking medical treatment, there
are three stake holders; the person himself, his family members and doctor
treating the patient. No person could take decision regarding life of another
unless he is entitled to take such decision authorized under any law. The
English Courts had applied the ""best interests"" test in case of a incompetent
person. The best interests of the patient had to be found out not by doctor




     08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 217) www.manupatra.com         OP Jindal Global Universitytreating the patient alone but a team of doctors specifically nominated by the
State Authority. The present Court was of the opinion that in cases of
incompetent patients who are unable to take an informed decision, it was in
the best interests of the patient that the decision be taken by competent
medical experts. The medical team while taking decision shall also take into
consideration the opinion of the blood relations of the patient and other
relevant facts and circumstances. [563] and[564]

(vi) The concept of advance medical directive is also called living will is of
recent origin, which gained recognition in latter part of 20th century. Many
people living depending on machines cause great financial distress to the
family with the cost of long term medical treatment. Advance medical directive

was developed as a means to restrict the kinds of medical intervention in
event when one become incapacitated. The foundation for seeking direction
regarding advance medical directive is extension of the right to refuse medical
treatment and the right to die with dignity. When a competent patient has
right to take a decision regarding medical treatment, with regard to medical
procedure entailing right to die with dignity, the said right cannot be denied to
those patients, who have become incompetent to take an informed decision at
the relevant time. [566] and[567]

Facts:

This public interest petition raises very important issues concerning the entire
range of conduct and management, under the auspices of State Governments,
of sterilization procedures wherein women and occasionally men are sterilized
in camps or in accredited centers. The issues raised also include pre-operation
procedures and post-operative care or lack of it. A sterilization surgery does
not appear to be complicated and yet several deaths have taken place across
the country over the years. Undoubtedly, this needs looking into by the
Government of India and the State Governments and remedial and corrective
steps need to be taken. Persons who are negligent in the performance of their
duties must be held accountable and the victims and their family provided for.
It is time that women and men are treated with respect and dignity and not
as mere statistics in the sterilization program.

Sometime in 2005 the issue of sterilization procedures for females and males
under the Population Control and Family Planning program or the Public
Health program of the Government of India came up for consideration before
this Court in a petition filed by Ramakant Rai. The petition was substantially
decided by this Court on 1st March 2005 by passing several directions. The
directions are reported as Ramakant Rai (I) and Anr. v. Union of India and
Ors.

The Petitioner Devika Biswas is a public spirited individual of Araria district in
Bihar. She is a health rights activist with extensive professional experience in
the development and health sectors. What seems to have provoked Devika
Biswas in filing a writ petition Under Article 32 of the Constitution in this




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global UniversityCourt is that on 7th January 2012 as many as 53 women underwent a
sterilization procedure in a camp in highly unsanitary conditions in Kaparfora
Government Middle School, Kursakanta, Araria district in Bihar between 8
p.m. and 10 p.m. through a single surgeon. In fact, some of the broad issues
concerning the sterilization camp held on 7th January 2012 as found on
investigation by Devika Biswas, included an absence of pre-operative tests on
the women or proposed patients; they were not given any counseling of any
kind at all; they had no idea about the potential dangers and outcomes of the
sterilization procedure; the sterilization procedures were carried out in a
school and not in a government hospital or a private accredited hospital;
running water was not available at the site; the sterilization procedures were
carried out under torch light with the women being placed on a school desk;
the surgeon did not have any gloves or at least did not change the gloves
available with him; no emergency arrangements were made etc. etc.

Essentially, the entire camp was conducted in unsanitary conditions, in an
unprofessional and unethical manner. What is worse is that the camp was
conducted under the auspices of an NGO called Jai Ambey Welfare Society
who had been granted accreditation by the District Health Society only a few
months earlier that is on 29th November, 2011 apparently without following
any formal and transparent procedure.

As a result of the sterilization camp, many women who were operated upon
Consequently, a series of complaints were filed and they were registered at
Kursakanta Police Station on 8th January 2012. Some of these complaints
were inquired into by the State authorities and it was found that the
sterilization camp was a success except that an expired medicine had been
given to the women. On the other hand, the study and the investigations
carried out by Devika Biswas along with a journalist called Francis Elliott
concluded that the sterilization camp did not meet any of the requirements
laid down by this Court or by the Government of India and that this was
confirmed by the women who were operated upon as well as their relatives.

Devika Biswas then felt compelled to file a public interest litigation in this
Court to ensure that sterilization procedures nationwide are conducted in
accordance with accepted legal norms, medical procedures and the provisions
of the manuals and that those women and men who suffer due to the failure
or complications in implementing the norms, procedures and provisions are
given adequate compensation. That is really the core issue raised by Devika
Biswas and that such instances are not repeated.

Devika Biswas prayed for a series of directions including setting up a
committee to investigate the facts relating to the sterilization camp held on
7th January 2012 and to initiate departmental and criminal proceedings
against those who were involved in the sterilization camp. It is also prayed
that the guidelines given in the manuals prepared by the Government of India
should be scrupulously adhered to so that such incidents do not recur in any
part of the country and if they do, additional compensation should be paid to
the women in distress.

Held, while disposing of the Petition




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global University1. In this writ petition, the Court is primarily concerned with the affidavits of
the Union of India, the States of Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra
and Rajasthan since allegations have been made in respect of sterilization
camps held in these States only. However, during the course of hearing of this
writ petition, allegations surfaced with regard to sterilization camps
conducted in Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh [between 8th and 10th November
2014] and so the Court is also concerned with the allegations made in respect
of the camps conducted in that State as well.[15]

2. What was brought to Court's notice with regard to the sterilization camps
conducted in Bilaspur district was that as many as 137 women were subjected
to a sterilization procedure and unfortunately 13 of them died. Many others
complained of problems such as vomiting, difficulty in breathing, severe pain
etc. They were taken to nearby hospitals and discharged after necessary
treatment. It appeared that some women who had not undergone a
sterilization procedure also had similar complaints and some of them died
thereby increasing the number of deaths to over 13. Undoubtedly, this was a
matter of great concern brought to Court's notice during the pendency of the
writ petition.[16]

3. Since the proceedings in this case were not adversarial in nature the Court
requested the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing in the matter as
to implement the Standard Operating Procedures and the Guidelines laid how
down by the Union of India in the matter of sterilization procedures.[30]

4. Affidavits have been filed by Union of India and States of Bihar, Kerala,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Devika Biswas
has pointed out in various affidavits filed during the pendency of this writ
petition that the campaign for sterilization is effectively a relentless campaign
for female sterilization. The web portal of the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare of the Government of India provides statistics on the number of
sterilization procedures conducted in the country for 2012-13. The portal
indicates that 97.4% of all sterilization procedures during this period were of
women. Devika Biswas alleges that the entire family planning program of
Chhattisgarh focuses on female sterilization and the National Health Mission
Project Implementation Plan sets targets for female sterilization and allocates
85% of the family planning budget exclusively to female sterilization.[60]

5. More or less confirming the allegations made by Devika Biswas, the
affidavits filed by Madhya Pradesh, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Goa reflect
the fact that the over-whelming number of sterilization procedures is targeted
towards women and there is virtually no attention paid to male sterilization.
[61]

6. Devika Biswas has also pointed out that data released by the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare during the period 2010-13 shows that at least 363
people have died as a result of sterilization procedures, a very large number
of such procedures have failed and that there have been severe complications
in respect of several persons who underwent a sterilization procedure. This
has resulted in payment of compensation of at least Rs. 50 crores.[62]




     08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University7. The principal problem pointed out by Devika Biswas is with regard to the
implementation of the various processes and guidelines issued by the
Government of India from time to time. Mere issuance of guidelines by the
Government of India does not guarantee their implementation. It is pointed
out (for example) that the list of empanelled doctors is not readily available;
consent forms are not available in the local language except in the Union
Territory of Puducherry; unrealistic targets have been set for sterilization
procedures with the result that non-consensual and forced sterilizations are
taking place, including of persons who are physically or mentally challenged.
Some young persons have been sterilized to meet targets and by and large
illiterate persons are sterilized. Devika Biswas is opposed to setting of targets
and says that she has the support of the Government of India in this regard,
but unfortunately State Governments and Union Territories are still setting
informal targets for sterilization.[63]

8. It is further pointed out that there is inadequate monitoring of sterilization
camps and facilities. There is little or no monitoring in most camps and health
centres, accountability measures are not in place and the rights of thousands
of women who undergo sterilization procedures are violated. It is not enough
for the Government of India to show that it is merely playing a supportive and
facilitative role since the campaign is a national campaign and if it is not
properly implemented, it merely leads to passing the buck with the State
Government blaming the Government of India and vice versa.[64]
9. The strengthening of the Quality Assurance Committees (QAC) and the
District Quality Assurance Committees (DQAC) is crucial to the success of a
family planning program of which sterilization procedures is one of the
elements. Details of the constitution of QACs and DQACs are not available on
the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. There is also no
indication of the steps and decisions taken by them or the minutes of their
meetings or reports submitted by them. In other words, vital information is
simply not available. Devika Biswas doubts whether these Committees meet
on a regular basis although it would be appropriate for them to have at least
quarterly meetings if not meetings every six months.[65]

10. According to her, unless these existing institutions function effectively
and efficiently or are made to function effectively and efficiently, it is very
unlikely that any meaningful progress will be made in the family planning
program of the Government of India, of which sterilization is an important
component.[66]

11. With regard to the Family Planning Indemnity Scheme, it is pointed out
that regular reviews are not carried out; the utilization of funds made
available under the     Scheme are mere figures since the details of
disbursements in case of death, failure, complication etc. are simply not
available anywhere. There is no indication of the number of claims filed, the
number of claims rejected and the reasons for the rejection and the amount
provided to each successful claimant. The Scheme requires a death audit to be
carried out but that is more or less missing in every instance. It is stated that
specialists who are conversant with the Scheme are not available at
sterilization camps and health centres to explain the Scheme in detail so that




     08-08-2022 (Page 5 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitythere is no difficulty or complication faced in the event of an unfortunate
mishap. It should be the duty of such a specialist to ensure that each person
proceeding to undergo a sterilization procedure has a copy of all the required
documents so that there is no difficultly faced later on. This will also ensure
that each person gives an informed consent to the sterilization procedure in a
language that he or she understands. In fact, all information that is
disseminated with regard to the sterilization procedure should be made
available in the local language at all Government health facilities and
accredited private facilities.[67]

12. It is high time, according to Devika Biswas, for the Government of India to
look at the quality of care made available to persons post a sterilization
procedure. As is clear from various documents on record including the Ms.
Anita Jha Commission Report, after-care facilities in terms of counseling,
assistance, follow-up etc. are totally absent.[68]

13. The fundamental error that the Union of India is making (and it has
repeated   that  in   its affidavits)  is  by  asserting   that  the   effective
implementation of the sterilization program is the concern of each State since
it is a ""Public health"" issue covered by Entry 6 of List II in the Seventh
Schedule (the State List) of the Constitution. Apart from the fact that the
various entries in the Seventh Schedule relate to legislative power, the error
made by the Union of India is in completely overlooking the more appropriate
and Family Planning"". This was inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second)l
Amendment Act, 1976. If the sterilization program is intended for population
control and family planning (which it undoubtedly is) there is no earthly
reason why the Union of India should refer to and rely on Entry 6 of the State
List and ignore Entry 20A of the Concurrent List.[69]

14. Population control and family planning has been and is a national
campaign over the last so many decades. Therefore, the responsibility for the
success or failure of the population control and family planning program (of
which sterilization procedure is an integral part) must rest squarely on the
shoulders of the Union of India. It is for this reason that the Union of India
has been taking so much interest in promoting it and has spent huge amounts
over the years in encouraging it. It is rather unfortunate that the Union of
India is now treating the sterilization program as a Public Health issue and
making it the concern of the State Government. This is simply not permissible
and appears to be a case of passing the buck.[69]

15. When the Union of India formulates schemes of national importance such
as family planning, their implementation is undoubtedly dependent on the
State Governments since they have the requisite mechanism for implementing
the schemes and can also take into account the needs that are particular to
the State and its people. In this manner, the cooperation of the Union of India
and all State Governments is indispensable to the success of such national
programs. Adverting to the provisions of the Constitution that allow for such
coordination between the Union and States, the Justice Sarkaria Commission
held that these provisions are not repugnant to but instead further the
principle of federalism.[71]





     08-08-2022 (Page 6 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University16. In the same manner, it is imperative for both the Union of India and the
State Governments to implement schemes announced by the Union of India in
a manner that respects the fundamental rights of the beneficiaries of the
scheme. Given the structure of cooperative federalism, the Union of India
cannot confine its obligation to mere enactment of a scheme without
ensuring its realization and implementation.[72]

17. Apart from anything else, by not giving the sterilization program the
importance it deserves (apart from other methods of population control and
family planning) and trying to pass the buck to the State Governments, the
Union of India is attempting to find an excuse for failure in its duty of
effectively monitoring a program of national importance. This game of passing
the parcel and treating a national program as a public health issue has to stop
and somebody must take ownership of the Population Control and Family
Planning program.[73]

18. To compound the problem, and it is much more than a pity, our country
does not seem to have any health policy. The draft of a National Health Policy,
2015 was put up on the website on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
of the Government of India in December 2014 for comments, suggestions and
feedback but even after more than one and a half years, the website of the
said Ministry shows that the National Health Policy has not been finalized.
[74]
19. The draft National Health Policy states that its primary aim is to
""...inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritize the role of the Government in
shaping health system in all its dimensions..."" The draft recognizes the
correlation between health and development and also recognizes the high
inequity in access to health care.[75]

20. With respect to sterilization, it states that sterilization related deaths are
a direct consequence of poor health care quality and is a preventable tragedy.
It also recognizes that female sterilizations are safest if performed in an
operation theatre which is functional throughout the year and by a
professional team with support systems which are in constant use. Camp
mode for such operations itself becomes a reason for unsatisfactory quality.
More monetary and human resource investment is required for the National
Rural Health Mission.[76]

21. Increase in the proportion of male sterilization in the total sterilizations
from the existing 5% to at least 30% is stated to be another policy
imperative under the health policy. Coercive methods are not justified and are
not even effective in meeting the goals of population control. Improved
access, education and empowerment should be the aim.[77]

22. A perusal of the various affidavits on record indicates that the sterilization
program is virtually a relentless campaign for female sterilization. This is
more or less confirmed from the figures available on the website of the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India. The issue
of male versus female sterilizations was debated and discussed during the
course of the hearings and it was conceded by all the learned Counsel that
the sterilization program cannot be targeted primarily towards women but




     08-08-2022 (Page 7 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitymust also actively include the sterilization of men as well. It appears to the
Court, without going into the merits and demerits of the incentives given for
undergoing the sterilization procedure, the documents on record indicate that
the incentive given to males for undergoing a sterilization procedure is less
than it is for females and that may perhaps be one of the reasons why the
percentage of males being sterilized is so remarkably low as compared to
females. This is an area that the Union of India must address itself to, if
nothing else then at least for reasons of gender equity.[79] and[80]

23. The manner in which sterilization procedures have reportedly been carried
out endanger two important components of the right to life Under Article 21
of the Constitution-the right to health and the reproductive rights of a person.
[81]

24. It is well established that the right to life Under Article 21 of the
Constitution includes the right to lead a dignified and meaningful life and the
right to health is an integral facet of this right. In C.E.S.C. Limited and Ors. v.
Subhash Chandra Bose and Ors. dealing with the right to health of workers, it
was noted that the right to health must be considered an aspect of social
justice informed by not only Article 21 of the Constitution, but also the
Directive Principles of State Policy and international covenants to which India
is a party. Similarly, the bare minimum obligations of the State to ensure the
preservation of the right to life and health were enunciated in Paschim Banga
Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of W.B.[82]
25. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Ors. this Court underlined
the obligation of the State to ensure that the fundamental rights of weaker
Sections of society are not exploited owing to their position in society. That
the right to health is an integral part of the right to life does not need any
repetition.[83] and[84]

26. Over time, there has been recognition of the need to respect and protect
the reproductive rights and reproductive health of a person. Reproductive
health has been defined as ""the capability to reproduce and the freedom to
make informed, free and responsible decisions. It also includes access to a
range of reproductive health information, goods, facilities and services to
enable individuals to make informed, free and responsible decisions about
their reproductive behaviour."" The Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights in General Comment No. 22 on the Right to Sexual and
Reproductive Health Under Article 12 of the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights observed that ""The right to sexual and
reproductive health is an integral part of the right of everyone to the highest
attainable physical and mental health.""[85]

27. This Court recognized reproductive rights as an aspect of personal liberty
Under Article 21 of the Constitution in Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh
Administration. The freedom to exercise these reproductive rights would
include the right to make a choice regarding sterilization on the basis of
informed consent and free from any form of coercion. The issue of informed
consent in respect of sterilization programs was considered by the Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in A.S. v. Hungary, where
the Committee found Hungary to have violated Articles 10(h), 12 and 16,




     08-08-2022 (Page 8 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universityparagraph 1(e) of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against
Women by performing a sterilization operation on A.S. while she was brought
in for a caesarean by making her sign a consent form that she did not fully
understand. The Committee found that it was not plausible to hold that, in
the brief period of 17 minutes commencing from her admission in the hospital
to the completion of the surgical procedures, that the hospital personnel
provided her with sufficient counselling and information about sterilization,
as well as alternatives, risks and benefits, to ensure that she could make a
well-considered and voluntary decision to be sterilized.[86]

28. It is necessary to re-consider the impact that policies such as the setting
of informal targets and provision of incentives by the Government can have on
the reproductive freedoms of the most vulnerable groups of society whose
economic and social conditions leave them with no meaningful choice in the
matter and also render them the easiest targets of coercion. The cases of
Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity and Bandhua Mukti Morcha have
emphasized that the State's obligation in respect of fundamental rights must
extend to ensuring that the rights of the weaker Sections of the community
are not exploited by virtue of their position. Thus, the policies of the
Government must not mirror the systemic discrimination prevalent in society
but must be aimed at remedying this discrimination and ensuring substantive
equality. In this regard, it is necessary that the policies and incentive
schemes are made gender neutral and the unnecessary focus on female
sterilization is discontinued.[87]
29. On the basis of the submissions before it, the Court has highlighted some
key issues that need active consideration. In addition, Court's attention was
repeatedly drawn to the guidelines given by this Court in Ramakant Rai (I)
and while it is generally the case of the Union of India and all the States that
the guidelines are being followed, the Court found that at least in respect of
some of them, there is still much more that needs to be done for their
effective implementation not only in letter but also in spirit. Some fine-tuning
is also necessary in view of the passage of time, change in circumstances and
the need to use technology to the optimum. Accordingly, the Court found it
necessary to issue the following supplementary directions:[88]

(1) The State-wise, district-wise or region-wise panel of doctors approved for
carrying out the sterilization procedure, must be accessible through the
website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of
India as well the corresponding Ministry or Department of each State
Government and each Union Territory. The list should contain all necessary
particulars of each doctor and not merely the name and designation. This
exercise should be completed on or before 31st December, 2016 and
thereafter the list be updated every quarter that is by 31st March, 30th June,
30th September and 31st December of every year.

(2) The contents of the checklist prepared pursuant to the directions given in
Ramakant Rai (I) should be explained to the proposed patient in a language
that he or she understands and the proposed patient should also be explained
the impact and consequences of the sterilization procedure. This can be
achieved by (a) ensuring that the checklist is in the local language of the
State; (b) it should contain a certificate duly signed by the concerned doctor




     08-08-2022 (Page 9 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitythat the proposed patient has been explained the contents of the checklist
and has understood its contents as well as the impact and consequences of
the sterilization procedure; (c) in addition to the certificate given by the
doctor, the checklist must also contain a certificate given by a trained
counselor (who may or may not be an ASHA worker) to the same effect as the
certificate given by the doctor. This will ensure that the proposed patient has
given an informed consent for undergoing the sterilization procedure and not
an incentivized consent.

Sufficient breathing time of about an hour or so should be given to a proposed
patient so that in the event he or she has a second thought, time is available
for a change of mind.

The checklist prepared pursuant to the direction given in Ramakant Rai (I)
with the aforesaid modifications should be prepared in the local or regional
language on or before 31st December, 2016.

(3) The Quality Assurance Committee (QAC) as well as the District Quality
Assurance Committee (DQAC) has been set up in every State and District in
terms of the directions given in Ramakant Rai (I). However, it is only the
designation of its members that has been made available. The details and
necessary particulars of each member of the QAC and DQAC should be
accessible from the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of
each State Government and each Union Territory on or before 31st December,f
2016 and thereafter updated every quarter.

(4) In addition to the six monthly reports required to be published by the QAC
containing of the number of persons sterilized as well as the number of
deaths or complications arising out of the sterilization procedure, as already
directed in Ramakant Rai (I), the QAC must publish an Annual Report (on the
website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of
India as well the corresponding Ministry or Department of each State
Government and each Union Territory) containing not only the statistical
information as earlier directed, but also non-statistical information in the
form of a report card indicating the meetings held, decisions taken, work done
and the achievements of the year etc. This will have a significant monitoring
and supervisory impact on the sterilization program and will also ensure the
active involvement of all the members of the QAC and the DQAC.

The first such Annual Report covering the calendar year 2016 should be
published on the websites mentioned above on or before 31st March, 2017.

(5) As many as 363 deaths have taken place due to sterilization procedures
during 2010-2013. This is a high figure. During this period, more than Rs. 50
crores have been disbursed towards compensation in cases of death. Apart
from steps taken by Bihar and Chhattisgarh during the pendency of the writ
petition to mitigate the sufferings of the patients, the Court has not been told
of any death audit conducted by any State Government or Union Territory in
respect of any patient, nor has it been informed of any steps taken against
any doctor or anybody else involved in the sterilization procedure that has
resulted in the death of a patient or any failure or any other complication




    08-08-2022 (Page 10 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityconnected with the sterilization procedure. There is a need for transparency
coupled with accountability and the death of a patient should not be treated
as a one-off aberration. Therefore, it is directed that the Annual Report
prepared by the QAC must indicate the details of all inquiries held and
remedial steps taken.

(6) With regard to the implementation of the Family Planning Indemnity
Scheme (FPIS), there does not seem to be any definitive information with
regard to the number of claims filed, the claims accepted and in which
category (death, failure, complication etc.), claims pending (and since when)
and claims rejected and the reasons for rejection. The QAC is directed to
include this information in the Annual Report and the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare of the Government of India as well as the State Governments
should make this information accessible on the website, including the
quantum of compensation paid under each category and to the number of
persons.

The Court has mentioned above that the learned Solicitor General had assured
it on 20th March, 2015 that full details of the funds utilized under the FPIS
would be furnished but that information has not been given as yet,
necessitating the direction that it has passed.

In addition to the direction relating to the FPIS, the Ministry of Health and
Government of India have been utilized for the purpose for which they werehe
given for the period from 2013-14 onwards.

(7) The quantum of compensation fixed under the Family Planning Indemnity
Scheme (FPIS) deserves to be increased substantially and the burden thereof
must be equally shared by the Government of India and the State
Government. The State of Chhattisgarh has shown the way in this regard and
it would be appropriate if others follow the lead. Every death or failure or
complication related to the sterilization procedure is a set-back not only to
the patient and his or her family but also in the implementation of the
national campaign. The Court declined to fix the quantum of compensation
but would suggest, following the example of the State of Chhattisgarh, that
the amount should be doubled and shared equally.

(8) The Union of India is directed to persuade the State Governments to halt
the system of holding sterilization camps as has been done by at least four
States across the country. In any event, the Union of India should adhere to
its view that sterilization camps will be stopped within a period of three
years. In Court's opinion, this will necessitate simultaneous strengthening of
the Primary Health Care centres across the country both in terms of
infrastructure and otherwise so that health care is made available to all
persons. The significance of having well equipped Primary Health Centres
across the country certainly cannot be over-emphasized. Therefore, the Court
directed the Union of India to pay attention to this as well, since it is
absolutely important that all citizens of our country have access to primary
health care.

(9) The Union of India should make efforts to ensure that sterilization camps




    08-08-2022 (Page 11 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityare discontinued as early as possible but in any case within the time frame
already fixed and adverted to above. The Union of India and the State
Governments must simultaneously ensure that Primary Health Centres are
strengthened.

(10) Although the Union of India has stated that no targets have been fixed
for the implementation of the sterilization program, it appears that there is an
informal system of fixing targets. The Court left it to the good sense of the
each State Government and Union Territory to ensure that such targets are
not fixed so that health workers and others do not compel persons to undergo
what would amount to a forced or non-consensual sterilization merely to
achieve the target.

(11) The decisions taken in the high level meetings held on 15th May 2015
and 17th November 2015 as well as the National Summit on Family Planning
held on 5th and 6th April 2016 should be scrupulously implemented by the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India. The said
Ministry should also ensure effective implementation of the decisions taken
keeping in mind that the sterilization program is a part of a national
campaign.

(12) The Union of India is directed to ensure strict adherence to the
guidelines and standard operating procedures in the various manuals issued
campaign for Population Control and Family Planning. The Union of India hastional
overarching responsibility for the success of the campaign and it cannot shift
the burden of implementation entirely on the State Governments and Union
Territories on the ground that it is only a public health issue. As the Justice
Sarkaria Commission put it ""Population Control and Family Planning is a
matter of national importance and of common concern of the Union and the
States.""

(13) The Court is pained to note the extremely casual manner in which some
of the States have responded to this public interest petition. What stands out
is the response of the States of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and
Kerala in respect of which States allegations were made concerning
mismanagement in at least one sterilization camp. None of these States have
given any acceptable response to the allegations and the Court had no option
but to assume that the camps that have been referred to in the writ petition
were mismanaged as alleged by Devika Biswas. However, the matter should
not end here. The Court directed the Registry of this Court to transmit a copy
of this judgment to the Registrar General of the High Court in the States of
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Kerala for being placed before
the Chief Justice of the High Court. The Court requested the Chief Justice to
initiate a suo moto public interest petition to consider the allegations made
by Devika Biswas in respect of the sterilization camp(s) held in these States
(the allegations not having been specifically denied) and any other similar
laxity or unfortunate mishap that might be brought to the notice of the Court
and pass appropriate orders thereon. The Court also directed the Registry of
this Court to transmit a copy of this judgment to the Registrar General of the
Patna High Court for being placed before the Chief Justice of the High Court.
The Court requested the Chief Justice to ensure speedy completion of the




    08-08-2022 (Page 12 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityinvestigations and proceedings relating to the mishap on 7th January 2012 in
the sterilization camp in Kaparfora Government Middle School, Kursakanta,
Araria district as well as the mishap in Chhapra in Saran district that led to
cancellation of the accreditation of Gunjan Maternity and Surgical Clinic on
24th March 2012.

(14) The State of Chhattisgarh is directed to implement the recommendations
given in the Ms. Anita Jha Report at the earliest and with all sincerity.

(15) The Court has already expressed its sadness at the fact that the National
Health Policy has not yet been finalized despite the passage of more than one
and a half years. The Court directed the Union of India to take a decision on
or before 31st December, 2016 on whether it would like to frame a National
Health Policy or not. In case the Union of India thinks it worthwhile to have a
National Health Policy, it should take steps to announce it at the earliest and
keep issues of gender equity in mind as well.

30. With the above supplementary directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
The Court recorded its appreciation for the efforts put in by Devika Biswas in
bringing this vital issue to the notice of this Court and to all the learned
Counsel and concerned officers of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of
the Government of India in not treating the public interest litigation as an
adversarial proceeding but as a collaborative effort to find a remedy to some
problems and improve the well being of the citizens of the country. [89]

","Consumer - Medical Negligence - Two surgeries performed upon Patient -
Patient after second surgery died due to cardiac arrest - Doctor cited poor
tolerance to anaesthesia - Claim raised awarded in favour of Claimants by
impugned judgment passed by National Consumer Disputes Redressal
Commission(NCDRC)- Hence, the present appeal - Appellants assailed the
judgment as bad in the absence of medical evidence - Whether impugned
judgment liable to be set aside?

Facts:

The present appeals were against impugned finding given by the NCDRC
holding Appellants guilty of medical negligence. Appeals were filed by doctor
who administered anaesthesia to the patient, hospital where operation was
performed and insurer from whom the anaesthetist and the hospital had
taken separate policy to the extent limited thereunder. In the instant case,
wife of the first claimant diagnosed with kidney stone could not survive in
procedure followed to treat her kidney issues. Claim was raised on account of
medical negligence caused. Hospital and doctor cited patient's poor tolerance
to anaesthesia. It was contended that two operations/ surgeries were
performed and second was performed in quick succession which caused
cardiac arrest. Impugned judgment adjudged Appellants liable of causing
medical negligence and directed compensation. Hence, the present appeal.

Held, while allowing the Appeal:

There was no medical evidence based on which conclusion was reached with
regard to the medical negligence. The observations of the NCDRC in their
opinion appears to be that the second operation ought not to have been
conducted and such conclusion in fact had led to the other issues also being




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 10) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universityanswered against the Appellants which is not backed by expert opinion.[22]

When there was no medical evidence available before the NCDRC on the
crucial medical aspect which required such opinion, the mere reliance placed
on the magisterial enquiry would not be sufficient. Though the opinion of the
civil surgeon who was a member of the committee is contained in the report,
the same cannot be taken as conclusive since such report does not have the
statutory flavour nor was the civil surgeon who had tendered his opinion
available for cross-examination or seeking answers by way of interrogatories
on the medical aspects. Mere legal principles and the general standard of
assessment was not sufficient in a matter of the present nature when the
very same patient in the same set up had undergone a successful operation
conducted by the same team of doctors. Hence, the conclusion as reached by
the NCDRC is not sustainable.[23]

For the aforesaid reasons, the order dated 13.08.2009 passed in O.P. No. 289
of 1997 is set aside. The appeals are accordingly allowed. There shall be no
order as to costs.[24]

In this public interest litigation filed on the basis of direction of the
Honourable Supreme Court of India in W.P. (Crl.) No. 237/89 Sheila Barse v.
Union of India, a petition was filed by the Co-ordinator of an NGO, concerned
with human rights. The petition brought into focus the practice of confining in
the nude, those mentally challenged with suicidal tendencies, which is a
practice prevalent in the mental health centres of the State. Petitioner
pointed out two instances which occurred in the Mental Health Centre,
Thrissur. The learned Single Judge called for report from the District Judge,
who is the Chairman of the monitoring committee about the incident and on
getting the report, directed the Psychiatric Society (Kerala) to offer
suggestions as to alternate arrangements that could be made without
exposing the mental health patients to the indignity of being confined nude in
the mental health centres. After hearing all stakeholders, the court issued
comprehensive directions to ensure that the mentally challenged patients are
not confined nude except in exceptional circumstances and to ensure that
accused/criminals who are mentally challenged should be taken back to their
place of confinement without delay and to expedite the trial of such persons.
The Court;

Held:




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 9)  www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global UniversityThe Superintendents of MHCs in the State and the Doctors attached thereat
shall ensure that none of the patients, even those showing acute suicidal
tendencies, when placed in seclusion, shall be so placed nude; unless very
acute situation warrants the same. If there is such a warrant then it would
have to be approved by a Committee of Doctors with the Superintendent in
the Chair and consisting of two other Psychiatrists; other than the attending
physician. In the rare event of such a seclusion being ordered and approved, it
shall be ensured that the subject patient is not exposed to anyone of the
opposite sex, not even from amongst the staff of the MHCs. But for these rare
cases, suitable dress for patients, kept in seclusion, can be devised by the
Superintendent of the MHCs in consultation with the Doctors in a Centre. In
this context, it would be necessary to provide for the specific dress which is to
be used in the case of the inmates in each of the MHCs, for which the
respective Superintendents shall consult with the Doctors within the MHCs
and issue specific orders in writing on that aspect. The DGP shall also issue
necessary orders to the Superintendents of the Jails to ensure that any
convict or undertrial prisoner sent to any of the MHCs shall be accompanied
with a report of the Medical Officer of the Prison, indicating the exact
offence/crime committed, the history of the patient, any earlier treatment
undertaken and the details of the family as available from the records of the
prison and a short note by the Medical Officer, as to the behavioural
tendencies of the individual convict. The Psychiatric Society is also requested
members of the MHCs and whether they could voluntarily take up suchstaff
training activities which could be commenced and continued in the various
MHCs at their convenience and in the frequency they would deem fit. The
Psychiatric Society would also think in lines of laying down a specific protocol
for dealing with oppressively distressed patients and place it for consideration
before this Court. With respect to undertrial prisoners, the Secretary, MHA and
the members of the Psychiatric Society express concern that they are not
taken back in time, after they are declared fit for standing trial and the cases
are also not taken up for trial within a reasonable period, causing relapse of
the condition, more for reason of they being again mixed with the general
population of convicts. These persons also could be placed in the
rehabilitation centres, proposed above, till the trial is commenced, carried on
and concluded. The Registrar General, High Court of Kerala, Kochi-682 031 is
also suo motu impleaded in the above I.A. and is directed to place on record
the measures which could be adopted to expedite the trial of such mentally ill
persons immediately on their being declared fit for trial so as to ensure that
they are not incarcerated indefinitely, pending trial. [21]

vaccines being administered in India; and direct the Respondent No. 2 to

India is directed to ensure that key findings and results of the relevant
phases of clinical trials of vaccines already approved by the regulatory
authorities for administration to children, be made public?

Facts:

In the Writ Petition, the Petitioner highlighted the adverse consequences of
emergency approval of vaccines in India, the need for transparency in
publishing segregated clinical trial data of vaccines, the need for disclosure of
clinical data, lack of transparency in regulatory approvals, minutes and
constitution of the expert bodies, imperfect evaluation of Adverse Events
Following Immunisation (AEFIs) and vaccine mandates in the absence of
informed consent being unconstitutional. The Petitioner further stated in the

principle of informed self-determination of individuals, protected by Article 21

Held, while disposing of the petition

1. In light of the virulent mutations of the COVID-19 virus and advice of
experts from the WHO as well as common findings of several studies on this
subject, the vaccination drive that is being undertaken by the Government of
India in the interest of public health cannot be faulted with.[40]

2. With regard to judicial review of policy decisions based on expert opinion is
concerned, there is no doubt that wide latitude is provided to the executive in
such matters and the Court does not have the expertise to appreciate and
decide on merits of scientific issues on the basis of divergent medical opinion.
question can be held to be beyond the pale of unreasonableness and manifestn
arbitrariness and to be in furtherance of the right to life of all persons,
bearing in mind the material on record. With respect to the infringement of
bodily integrity and personal autonomy of an individual considered in the light
of vaccines and other public health measures introduced to deal with the
COVID-19 pandemic, we are of the opinion that bodily integrity is protected
under Article 21 of the Constitution and no individual can be forced to be
vaccinated. Further, personal autonomy of an individual, which is a
recognised facet of the protections guaranteed under Article 21, encompasses
the right to refuse to undergo any medical treatment in the sphere of
individual health. However, in the interest of protection of communitarian
health, the Government is entitled to regulate issues of public health concern
by imposing certain limitations on individual rights, which are open to
scrutiny by constitutional courts to assess whether such invasion into an
individual's right to personal autonomy and right to access means of
livelihood meets the threefold requirement as laid down in Justice K.S.
Puttaswamy and Ors. v. Union of India (UOI) and Ors., i.e., (i) legality, which
presupposes the existence of law; (ii) need, defined in terms of a legitimate
State aim; and (iii) proportionality, which ensures a rational nexus between
the objects and the means adopted to achieve them. On the basis of
substantial material filed before this Court reflecting the near-unanimous
views of experts on the benefits of vaccination in addressing severe disease
from the infection, reduction in oxygen requirement, hospital and ICU
admissions, mortality and stopping new variants from emerging, this Court is
satisfied that the current vaccination policy of the Union of India is informed
by relevant considerations and cannot be said to be unreasonable or
manifestly arbitrary. Information relating to adverse effects following
immunisation is crucial for creating awareness around vaccines and their




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 42) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universityefficacy, apart from being instrumental in further scientific studies around the
pandemic. Recognising the imperative need for collection of requisite data of
adverse events and wider participation in terms of reporting, the Union of
India is directed to facilitate reporting of suspected adverse events by
individuals and private doctors on an accessible virtual platform. These
reports shall be made publicly accessible, without compromising on protecting
the confidentiality of the persons reporting, with all necessary steps to create
awareness of the existence of such a platform and of the information required
to navigate the platform to be undertaken by the Union of India at the
earliest. On paediatric vaccination, the decision taken by the Union of India to
vaccinate children in this country is in tune with global scientific consensus
and expert bodies like the WHO, the UNICEF and the CDC and it is beyond the
scope of review for this Court to second-guess expert opinion, on the basis of
which the Government has drawn up its policy. Keeping in line with the WHO
Statement on Clinical Trials and the extant statutory regime, the Union of
India is directed to ensure that key findings and results of the relevant
phases of clinical trials of vaccines already approved by the regulatory
authorities for administration to children, be made public at the earliest. [89]

Principles stated--Appellants have failed to make out any case of medical

While deciding whether the medical professional is guilty of medical
negligence following well known principles must be kept in viewÂ :

(I) Negligence is the breach of a duty exercised by omission to do something
which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily
regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a
prudent and reasonable man would not do.

(II) Negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence. The negligence to be
established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the
negligence merely based upon an error of judgment.

(III) The medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable degree of
skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither
the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence judged in the
light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law requires.

(IV) A medical practitioner would be liable only where his conduct fell below
that of the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in his field.

(V) In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is scope for genuine




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 21) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universitydifference of opinion and one professional doctor is clearly not negligent
merely because his conclusion differs from that of other professional doctor.

(VI) The medical professional is often called upon to adopt a procedure which
involves higher element of risk, but which he honestly believes as providing
greater chances of success for the patient rather than a procedure involving
lesser risk but higher chances of failure. Just because a professional looking
to the gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the
patient out of his/her suffering which did not yield the desired result may not
amount to negligence.

(VII) Negligence cannot be attributed to a doctor so long as he performs his
duties with reasonable skill and competence. Merely because the doctor
chooses one course of action in preference to the other one available, he
would not be liable if the course of action chosen by him was acceptable to
the medical profession.

(VIII) It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if
no Doctor could administer medicine without a halter round his neck.

(IX) It is our bounden duty and obligation of the civil society to ensure that
the medical professionals are not unnecessarily harassed or humiliated so
that   they  can   perform   their   professional  duties   without   fear  and
apprehension.
(X) The medical practitioners at times also have to be saved from such a class
of complainants who use criminal process as a tool for pressurizing the
medical professionals / hospitals particularly private hospitals or clinics for
extracting uncalled for compensation. Such malicious proceedings deserve to
be discarded against the medical practitioners.

(XI) The medical professionals are entitled to get protection so long as they
perform their duties with reasonable skill and competence and in the interest
of the patients. The interest and welfare of the patients have to be paramount
for the medical professionals.

As long as the doctors have performed their duties and exercised an ordinary
degree of professional skill and competence, they cannot be held guilty of
medical negligence. It is imperative that the doctors must be able to perform
their professional duties with free mind.

Ratio Decidendi:
""Doctors performing their duties and exercise an ordinary degree of
professional skill and competence cannot be held guilty of negligence.""

the Doctor did not take any steps to surgically remove or repair any internal
organ and closed the incision which lead to recurrence of severe pain.
Plaintiff alleged that the Doctor acted negligently as a result of which she
was not in a position to take up employment. Plaintiff claimed    ' 1,00,000 as
damages. On the other hand, defendants contended that Hysterectomy
operation was not done as plaintiff's internal organs were in such a position
that the operation could not be done. Trial Court dismissed the suit and
appeal was taken. The learned Single Judge held that Negligence is failure to
exercise reasonable care and attention expected from a skilled professional
and mere error in identifying the disease or lack of high skill may not amount
to negligence. On facts, the Court held that there is no reason to reverse the
decision of trial Court and;

Held:

In order to fasten liability on a medical practitioner, the court has to ascertain
whether there was intentional act or omission or failure on his/her side in
administering treatment to one's patient. If only there was breach or failure
to follow the practice acceptable on the part of medical professional and
reasonable care, attention and requisite skill expected from an expert, were
not provided to save a patient from acute emergency, negligence can be
attributed against a doctor. A doctor who is treating a patient may only think
to relieve him/her from the sufferings and the well being of the patient will
be the sole aim of the doctor and normally with all care and skill the doctors




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 12)  www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universitywill try their level best to save the patient. Normally, a doctor will be taking
the effort and risk even in cases where hard and risk factors are involved with
the ultimate aim to save the patient and he/she will be satisfied only if the
best treatment is provided to the patient. But, unfortunately an error or
wrong judgment may happen in rare cases. It is well-settled that a mere error
or a mistake in identifying the disease or lack of high skill may not amount to
negligence. Negligence is a failure to exercise appropriate care and attention
expected to be exercised in the circumstances. Failure to attend or to give
prompt treatment in case of emergency, administration of drug by way of
injection, without test dose or adequate precautions, when there is possibility
of drug allergy or sensitivity, will amount to negligence. If requisite skill,
reasonable attention and reasonable care are provided to a patient, a doctor
can not be said to be negligent in his activities. But mistake or error of
Judgment does not necessarily establish negligence. [21]

Writ Petition was filed for declaring ""right to sexuality"", ""right to sexual
autonomy"" and ""right to choice of a sexual partner"" to be part of the right to
life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and further to
declare Section 377 of IPC to be unconstitutional.It is urged by the learned
Counsel for the Petitioners that individuals belonging to the LGBT group suffer
discrimination and abuse throughout their lives due to the existence of Section
377 of IPC which is nothing but a manifestation of a mindset of societal values
prevalent during the Victorian era where sexual activities were considered
mainly for procreation. The said community remains in a constant state of fear
which is not conducive for their growth. It is contended that they suffer at the
hands of law and are also deprived of the citizenry rights which are protected
under the Constitution. Petitioners face a violation of their fundamental rights
to an extent which is manifestly clear and it is a violation which strikes at the
very root or substratum of their existence. The discrimination suffered at the
hands of the majority, the onslaught to their dignity and invasion on the right
to privacy is demonstrably visible and permeates every nook and corner of the
society. It is the argument of the Petitioners that Section 377, if retained in its
present form, would involve the violation of, not one but, several fundamental
rights of the LGBTs, namely, right to privacy, right to dignity, equality, liberty
and right to freedom of expression. The Petitioners contend that sexual
orientation which is a natural corollary of gender identity is protected under
Article 21 of the Constitution and any discrimination meted out to the LGBT
community on the basis of sexual orientation would run counter to the
mandate provided under the Constitution and the said view has also gained
approval of this Court in the NALSA case.

Held, while allowing the petitions

communities. It is intrinsic to their dignity, inseparable from their autonomy
and at the heart of their privacy. Section 377 is founded on moral notions
which are an anathema to a constitutional order in which liberty must trump
over stereotypes and prevail over the mainstreaming of culture. [500]

2. The impact of Section 377 has travelled far beyond criminalising certain
acts. The presence of the provision on the statute book has reinforced
stereotypes about sexual orientation. It has lent the authority of the state to
the suppression of identities. The fear of persecution has led to the closeting
of same sex relationships. A penal provision has reinforced societal disdain.
[501]

3. Sexual and gender based minorities cannot live in fear, if the Constitution
has to have meaning for them on even terms. In its quest for equality and the
equal protection of the law, the Constitution guarantees to them an equal
citizenship. In de-criminalising such conduct, the values of the Constitution
assure to the LGBT community the ability to lead a life of freedom from fear
and to find fulfilment in intimate choices. [502]

4. The choice of a partner, the desire for personal intimacy and the yearning to
find love and fulfilment in human relationships have a universal appeal,




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 207) www.manupatra.com         OP Jindal Global Universitystraddling age and time. In protecting consensual intimacies, the Constitution
adopts a simple principle: the state has no business to intrude into these
personal matters. Nor can societal notions of heteronormativity regulate
constitutional liberties based on sexual orientation. [503]

5. Present case has had great deal to say on the dialogue about the
transformative power of the Constitution. In addressing LGBT rights, the
Constitution speaks-as well-to the rest of society. In recognising the rights of
the LGBT community, the Constitution asserts itself as a text for governance
which promotes true equality. It does so by questioning prevailing notions
about the dominance of sexes and genders. [505]

6. A hundred and fifty eight years is too long a period for the LGBT community
to suffer the indignities of denial. That it has taken sixty eight years even after
the advent of the Constitution is a sobering reminder of the unfinished task
which lies ahead. It is also a time to invoke the transformative power of the
Constitution. [506]
7. The ability of a society to acknowledge the injustices which it has
perpetuated is a mark of its evolution. In the process of remedying wrongs
under a regime of constitutional remedies, recrimination gives way to
restitution, diatribes pave the way for dialogue and healing replaces the hate
of a community. For those who have been oppressed, justice under a regime
committed to human freedom, has the power to transform lives. In addressing
the causes of oppression and injustice, society transforms itself. The
Constitution has within it the ability to produce a social catharsis. The
importance of this case lies in telling us that reverberations of how we address
social conflict in our times will travel far beyond the narrow alleys in which
they are explored. [507]

8. Article 21 provides that no person shall be deprived of his life or personal
liberty except according to the procedure established by law. Such procedure
established by law must be fair, just and reasonable. The right to life and
liberty affords protection to every citizen or non-citizen, irrespective of their
identity or orientation, without discrimination. The right to privacy has now
been recognised to be an intrinsic part of the right to life and personal liberty
Under Article 21. Sexual orientation is an innate part of the identity of LGBT
persons. Sexual orientation of a person is an essential attribute of privacy. Its
protection lies at the core of Fundamental Rights guaranteed by Articles 14,
15, and 21. The right to privacy is broad-based and pervasive under our
Constitutional scheme, and encompasses decisional autonomy, to cover
intimate/personal decisions and preserves the sanctity of the private sphere of
and has travelled far beyond that initial concept. It now incorporates the ideas,
of spatial privacy, and decisional privacy or privacy of choice.315 It extends to
the right to make fundamental personal choices, including those relating to
intimate sexual conduct, without unwarranted State interference. Section 377
affects the private sphere of the lives of LGBT persons. It takes away the
decisional autonomy of LGBT persons to make choices consistent with their
sexual orientation, which would further a dignified existence and a meaningful
life as a full person. Section 377 prohibits LGBT persons from expressing their
sexual orientation and engaging in sexual conduct in private, a decision which
inheres in the most intimate spaces of one's existence. [524]




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 207) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University9. The right to health, and access to healthcare are also crucial facets of the
right to life guaranteed Under Article 21 of the Constitution.317 LGBT persons
being a    sexual   minority have    been   subjected to    societal  prejudice,
discrimination and violence on account of their sexual orientation. Since
Section 377 criminalises ""carnal intercourse against the order of nature"" it
compels LGBT persons to lead closeted lives. As a consequence, LGBT persons
are seriously disadvantaged and prejudiced when it comes to access to health-
care facilities. This results in serious health issues, including depression and
suicidal tendencies amongst members of this community.318 LGBT persons,
and more specifically the MSM, and transgender persons are at a higher risk of
contracting HIV as they lack safe spaces to engage in safe-sex practices. They
are inhibited from seeking medical help for testing, treatment and supportive
care on account of the threat of being 'exposed' and the resultant prosecution.
Higher rates of prevalence of HIV-AIDS in MSM, who are in turn married to
other people of the opposite sex, coupled with the difficulty in detection and
transmission of the virus. [524.3]ptible to contraction and further

10. Article 19(1)(a) guarantees freedom of expression to all citizens. However,
reasonable restrictions can be imposed on the exercise of this right on the
grounds specified in Article 19(2). LGBT persons express their sexual
orientation in myriad ways. One such way is engagement in intimate sexual
acts like those proscribed Under Section 377. Owing to the fear of harassment
from law enforcement agencies and prosecution, LGBT persons tend to stay 'in
the closet'. They are forced not to disclose a central aspect of their personal
identity i.e. their sexual orientation, both in their personal and professional
spheres to avoid persecution in society and the opprobrium attached to
homosexuality. Unlike heterosexual persons, they are inhibited from openly
forming and nurturing fulfilling relationships, thereby restricting rights of full
personhood and a dignified existence. It also has an impact on their mental
well-being. [525.1]

11. History owes an apology to the members of this community and their
families, for the delay in providing redressal for the ignominy and ostracism
that they have suffered through the centuries. The members of this community
were compelled to live a life full of fear of reprisal and persecution. This was
on account of the ignorance of the majority to recognise that homosexuality is
a completely natural condition, part of a range of human sexuality. The mis-
application of this provision denied them the Fundamental Right to equality
guaranteed by Article 14. It infringed the Fundamental Right to non-
discrimination Under Article 15, and the Fundamental Right to live a life of
a life unshackled from the shadow of being 'unapprehended felons'. [528]o live

12. It is declared that insofar as Section 377 criminalises consensual sexual
acts of adults (i.e. persons above the age of 18 years who are competent to
consent) in private, is violative of Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the
Constitution. It is, however, clarified that, such consent must be free consent,
which is completely voluntary in nature, and devoid of any duress or coercion.
The declaration of the aforesaid reading down of Section 377 shall not,
however, lead to the reopening of any concluded prosecutions, but can
certainly be relied upon in all pending matters whether they are at the trial,

govern non-consensual sexual acts against adults, all acts of carnal
intercourse against minors, and acts of beastiality. The judgment in Suresh K.

","Indian Penal Code, 1860 - Section 338 read with Section 109--Causing
grievous hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others and
abetment--Conviction and sentence--Sustainability--Patient suffering from
metastatic breast cancer--Acute chronic cancer condition was cause of
patient's death--It cannot be said that advice of appellant for taking surgical
procedure was act of wanton negligence--Negligent conduct in nature of
omission of appellant is not so gross as to entail liability on appellant under
Section 338--Crime as mentioned in Section 338 requires proof that appellant
caused patient's condition to acute stage--Though conduct of appellant
(doctor) constituted not only professional misconduct for which adequate
penalty meted out to him by Medical Council, and negligence on his part also
amounts to actionable wrong in tort--It does not transcend into criminal
liability and in no case makes him liable for offence under Section 338 as
ingredients of that provision not satisfied--Merely on basis of negligence, it
could not be held that ingredients of Section 338 stood proved as it could not
amount to ""act"" of causing ""grievous hurt"" that too ""rationally and
negligently"" thereby endangering life of patient--Within realm of civil liability,
appellant breached well essence of ""duty""' to patient--Impugned judgments
of courts below set aside.

Questions that falls for determination is as to whether the alleged role of the
appellant amounts to ""doing any act"" and whether it was so rash or negligent
as to endanger the life of the patient.

Merely on the basis of negligence, it could not be held that ingredients of
Section 338 of I.P.C. stood proved as it could not amount to an ""act"" of
causing ""grievous hurt"", that too ""rationally and negligently"" thereby
endangering the life of the patient.




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 23)  www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global UniversityNo doubt, in the present case the appellant not only possesses requisite skills
but also an expert in this line. However, having advised the operation, he
failed to take care of the patient. Thereafter, at various stages, as observed by
the courts below, he was held to be negligent by the Maharashtra Medical
Council and thus found to be guilty of committing professional misconduct.

Thus, it was the appellant's ""duty"" to act contractually, professionally as well
as morally and such an omission can be treated as an ""act"". Undoubtedly,
within the realm of civil liability, the appellant has breached the well essence
of ""duty"" to the patient.

The appellant's omission in not rendering complete and undivided legally
owed duty to patient and not performing the procedure himself has not made
any difference. It was not the cause of the patient's death which was
undoubtedly because of the acute chronic cancer condition. In such a
scenario, it is enough to keep off the clutches of criminal law.

The negligent conduct in the nature of omission of the appellant is not so
gross as to entail criminal liability on the appellant under Section 338 of the
I.P.C. It is to be kept in mind that the crime as mentioned in Section 338,
I.P.C. requires proof that the appellant caused the patient's condition to the
acute stage.
For the reasons stated the Supreme Court has no option but to conclude that
though the conduct of the appellant constituted not only professional
misconduct for which adequate penalty has been meted out to him by the
Medical Council, and the negligence on his part also amounts to actionable
wrong in tort, it does not transcend into the criminal liability and in no case
makes him liable for offence under Section 338, I.P.C. as the ingredients of
that provision have not been satisfied.

Ratio Decidendi:
""Where negligence is an essential ingredient of offence, negligence to be
established by prosecution must be culpable or gross and not negligence
merely based upon an error of judgment.""

M.R. Shah, J.

1. By way of this petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioner -
original accused No. 1 - Santokben Sharmanbhai Jadeja has prayed for an appropriate

Revision Application No. 89 of 2007 in dismissing the same and confirming the order
passed by the learned JMFC, Junagadh granting Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping
Test of the petitioner.

2. At the outset, it is to be noted that against the State so many cases involving serious
offences such as Saurabuddin encounter case and others are pending in which the
question with regard to Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test of the concerned
accused are pending at different stages i.e. either at the stage of proceedings before the
learned Magistrate or revisional stage before the learned Sessions Court or before this
Court and considering timely requirement of such tests at the stage of investigation,
considering the above, this Court has considered present petition on merits. The
proceedings before the different trial Courts/revisional Courts hence, this petition is
considered on merits.

It was also brought to the notice of the Court that one proceeding is pending before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and the case is referred to the Larger Bench, and considering
the same an opportunity was given to the petitioner to move an appropriate application
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for transfer of the proceedings and twice this Court
granted time to the petitioner to move such an application for transfer in view of the
pending proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and in fact on 19.7.2007 at the

     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityto move an appropriate application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for transfer of the

has heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties on merits
and is deciding the present petition on merits.

3. Before dealing with the present petition on merits and the contentions on behalf of
the rival parties with regard to need of Narco Analysis Test and/or Brain Mapping Test,
few facts are necessary for the determination of the present petition to appreciate the
prayer of the Investigating Officer for conducting the Narco Analysis Test and/or Brain
Mapping Test of the petitioner.
4. An FIR is registered at Junagadh Taluka Police Station on 13.5.2007 given by one
Jyotiben Dilipbhai Pipariya against two accused persons named Mohan Amir Gohil and
Mahesh alias Bhaddo Mulji Chauhan for the offence punishable under Sections 302, 394,
376 and others of Indian Penal Code and as stated above, the said FIR is registered on
13.5.2007 being CR No. I - 69 of 2007. It appears that inspite of the best efforts made
by the Investigating Agency and the State, those two named accused persons could not
be arrested and they are absconding. At this stage it is required to be noted that there is
a hue and cry in the public with regard to the aforesaid incident and the offence
committed by the accused persons and agitation has taken place on large scale by the
public raised alleging inter alia the inaction on the part of the State and the
Investigating Agency in not able to arrest the accused persons of the aforesaid FIR.
During the course of the investigation of the CR I 69 of 2007 and on the basis of the
statement given by the sister of the accused of CR I 69 of 2007 - Mohan Hamir that the
said accused persons have contacted and met the petitioner and both of them requested
the petitioner to give shelter and accordingly said two persons accused are under her
shelter and therefore the FIR is registered on 8.6.2007 at Junagadh B Division Police
Station against the petitioner and four other unknown persons for the offence under
Sections 212, 506(2) and 114 of the Indian Penal Code and the said complaint is given
by the Police Inspector, Crime Branch, Junagadh alleging inter alia that the petitioner
has committed offence of harboring and sheltering as well as of criminal intimidation
and abetment. That the petitioner came to be arrested and Investigating Officer has
produced the petitioner before the learned JMFC, Junagadh and an application seeking
police remand for the period of 4 days was submitted which was objected by the
petitioner, however, considering the seriousness of the offence alleged, the learned
Magistrate by an order dated 10.6.2007 granted police remand of the petitioner upto
11.00 A.M. Of 13.6.2007. The said order was challenged by the petitioner before this
Court by way of Special Criminal Application No. 1101 of 2007 and the same was
withdrawn as having become infructuous. On expiry of the period of remand on
13.6.2007, an application for further remand for a period of 3 days was given by the
Investigating Officer however, the learned Magistrate by order dated 13.6.2007 rejected
the said application seeking further remand. The petitioner submitted an application for
bail and simultaneously the prosecuting agency gave an application on 11.6.2007 for
taking the petitioner for performing the Brain Mapping Test as well as Narco Analysis
Test. The said application was at Mark - 8. The said application came to be objected by
the petitioner on the ground which will be referred to hereinafter. The learned JMFC,
performing the Narco Analysis Test as well as the Brain Mapping Test vide order dated
13.6.2007. Being aggrieved by the said order, the petitioner gave an application for
staying the operation of the said order vide Exh.16 so as to enable the petitioner to
challenge the said order before the Revisional Court and the learned JMFC, Junagadh
stayed the operation of the order upto 26.6.2007. Against the order granting Narco
Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test, the petitioner preferred Criminal Revision




      08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityApplication No. 2007 in the Court of learned District & Sessions Judge, Junagadh on
18.6.2007. In the meantime, the learned JMFC passed an order to adjourn the hearing
of the bail application of the petitioner till the petitioner undertakes Narco Analysis Test
and Brain Mapping Test. The petitioner being aggrieved by the said order in deferring
the hearing of the bail application till the petitioner undertakes Narco Analysis Test and
Brain Mapping Test preferred Special Criminal Application No. 1132 of 2007 before this
Court and by order dated 29.6.2007 this Court directed the learned JMFC to decide and
dispose of the bail application with certain observations. Thereafter the said application
was heard by the learned JMFC and the learned JMFC allowed the said bail application
and released the petitioner on bail. That thereafter the aforesaid Criminal Revision
Application No. 89 of 2007 filed by the petitioner filed against the order of granting
Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test came to be heard by the learned Sessions
Judge who by his judgment and order dated 30.6.2007 dismissed the said Criminal
Revision Application and confirmed the order passed by the learned JMFC granting
application of the prosecution for taking the petitioner for performing Narco Analysis
Test and Brain Mapping Test. Against the order of rejection of the Criminal Revision
Application as well as the order passed by the learned JMFC, Junagadh granting
application of the prosecution for taking the petitioner for performing Narco Analysis
Test as well as Brain Mapping Test the petitioner-original accused has preferred present
Special Criminal Application under Article 227 of the Constitution of India.
5. Shri N.D. Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner has assailed
the order passed by the learned JMFC, Junagadh confirmed by the learned Additional
Sessions Judge, Junagadh in granting the application of the prosecution for taking the
petitioner for Narco Analysis Test as well as Brain Mapping Test on the following
grounds:

    (i) The learned Magistrate has committed serious and grave error in giving
    direction to the accused for undertaking Narco Analysis Test as well as Brain
    Mapping Test as the same violates the protection guaranteed under Article
    20(3) of the Constitution of India as the order containing the direction given is
    nothing but to compel the accused to give evidence against herself which is
    prohibited under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.

    (ii) The test involve injection of certain solution in the body of the witness and
    therefore, without the consent of the petitioner nothing can be injected in the
    body of the petitioner.
    (iii) The petitioner cannot be compelled to give statement which is self-
    incriminating and as such, such test is not considered as reliable and the drugs
    sought to be administered to the petitioner _ original accused is dangerous to
    the health of the petitioner.

    (iv) The petitioner is charged only for the offence under Sections 212 and
    506(2) of the Indian Penal Code which are trivial in nature and for which Narco
    Analysis Test and/or Brain Mapping Test are not required, more particularly,
    when the FIR is lodged after a long period and the informant is Police Inspector
    of Criminal Branch.

6 . Shri N.D. Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner has
vehemently submitted that in the criminal jurisprudence accepted in India, a person
facing an investigation is constitutionally conferred with the right viz. right to remain
silent, leaving it for the Investigating Agency to investigate the factual allegations




      08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universityresorting to only those methods which are specifically permitted under various statutory
provisions. It is submitted by him that the accused cannot be compelled to be a witness
against himself/herself by conducting such Narco Analysis Test and the same would
offend the constitutional protection guarantee under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of
India. Shri Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate has submitted that there are no statutory
provisions in the Criminal Procedure Code or any statutory remedies by which the
Investigating Agency can compel the accused to undergo any test including Narco
Analysis Test. It is further submitted by him that in the year 2002 the Law Commission
of India considered in detail the provisions of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India
in the context of right of silence given to the accused and has considered whether there
is any need or desirability or constitutional permissibility to amend the Criminal
Procedure Code so as to temper with the right conferred upon the accused against self-
incrimination and the Law Commission of India has filed its Report before the Central
Government and the Law Commission has examined the history behind conferment of
such a right upon an accused and also examined the pari materia provisions in United
Kingdom, Australia, USA, Canada, China and India and after a detailed and a careful
consideration, the Law Commission of India found that no amendment in Criminal
Procedure Code is necessary and any changes in law relating to silence of the accused,
if made, will be ultra-virus to Articles 20(3) and 21 of the Constitution of India. Shri
Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate has also further submitted that the question of such
test, which results into the accused being compelled to incriminate himself fell for
consideration by the National Human Rights Commission in the context of Polygraph
test and the said Commission considered the question of permissibility of a lesser
submitted that in the case of Polygraph test, the National Human Rights Commissionnd it is
prohibited commission of such a test without express and informed consent of the
accused. It is submitted that the Commission has laid down guidelines relating to the
said test on an accused in context of the constitutional guarantee embodied in part-III
of the Constitution of India in general and Article 20(3) of the Constitution in particular.
It is submitted that the said guidelines are sent to all the States. Therefore, it is
submitted that in light of the above, granting of application for Narco Analysis Test and
Brain Mapping Test of the petitioner would be against the protection and guarantee
conferred by Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India and the same has also no
statutory force. Shri Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the petitioner has
relied upon the decision of this Court in case of Najabhai Ranchhod and Anr. v. State of
Gujarat reported in MANU/GJ/0100/1971. He has also relied upon one another decision
of this Court in case of Haribhai Chanabhai Vora and Ors. v. Keshubhai Haribhai Vora
reported in MANU/GJ/0773/2004. In the said case the question was with regard to
conducting of D.N.A. Test. Shri Nanavati, learned Senior Advocatehas taken the Court
to the Law Commission's Report as well as the guidelines issued by the National Human
Rights Commission referred to hereinabove.

7. It is also further submitted by Shri Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate that police
remand was given and the petitioner was in police remand and the petitioner has
cooperated and nothing incriminating has been found against the petitioner. It is also
further submitted that the petitioner is changed only for the offences under Sections
212 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code and thus, looking to the offences as alleged,
such a drastic measure of injecting foreign chemical against the will of the petitioner is
not required. It is submitted that when the allegations are only under Section 202 of
harboring only the aforesaid two tests are not called for. It is submitted that the nature
of offences alleged is a relevant consideration for which such a drastic test is not
required. It is also further submitted by him that the method adopted in the commission
of crime by one or more accused is also relevant consideration like Telegi's case. It is



      08-08-2022 (Page 5 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universityalso further submitted by him that even if all the allegations levelled against the
petitioner are considered as gospel truth then also it is not a case for Narco Analysis
Test. It is also further submitted by him that identical question/controversy is pending
before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and the matter is referred to Larger Bench and
therefore, this Court should wait and/or should not pronounce any judgment in the
present case till the controversy is resolved by the Hon'ble Supreme Court and/or the
matter is decided by the Hon'ble Supreme Court. It is submitted by him that before the
Revisional Court the petitioner has specifically made out a ground with regard to
pendency of the proceedings before the Hon'ble Supreme Court but the Revisional Court
has not deal with the same at all. It is submitted by him that at least the learned
Revisional Court was expected to deal with and consider the same. It is submitted by
him that whenever the contention is raised and the submission is made, the Court is
bound to consider the same and dealt with the same and the Court cannot just ignore
the same and/or do not deal with the same. By making the aforesaid submissions, Shri
Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate has requested to quash and set aside the orders
passed by both the Courts below and reject the application of the prosecuting agency
for Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test of the petitioner.
8. Shri K.B. Trivedi, learned Advocate General was called by the Court to assist the
Court and he has submitted that at least four High Courts in the country have
considered the permissibility of the Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test on the
accused persons and have also considered the submissions and the contentions raised
on behalf of the accused persons with regard to the protection guaranteed under
Articles 20(3) & 21 of the Constitution of India and all the four High Courts have
elaborately considered all the aspects on the point and have permitted the Narco
Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test upon the accused persons. He has submitted that
the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in case of Ramchandra Reddy v. State of
Maharashtra reported in 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 1704   ; The Karnataka High Court in case of
Smt. Selvi and Ors. v. State by Koramangala Police Station decided on 10th September,
2007 in Criminal Petition No. 1964 of 2004; the Bombay High Court in case of Arun
Gulab Gavali v. State of Maharashtra reported in MANU/MH/1477/2005; the Madras
High Court in case of Dinesh Dalmia v. State reported in MANU/TN/8154/2006; and the
Andhra Pradesh High Court in case of K. Venkateshwara Rao, S/o K. Vijaya Simha,
Hydrabad v. State of A.P. Decided on 30th August, 2007 in Criminal Revision
Application No. 1402 of 2006 have taken a view that by performing/conducting the
Narco Analysis Test/Brain Mapping Test on the accused person, at the stage of
investigation do not violate the constitutional protection guaranteed under Article 20(3)
and 21 of the Constitution of India. It is also further submitted that in all the aforesaid
cases, the Courts have also considered the need of such scientific tests by observing
that it is a need for the day for such a scientific tests. Learned Advocate General has
also drawn the attention of the Court to the relevant materials in favour of conducting of
the Narco Analysis Test inclusive of the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights
Commission and the Report of the Law Commission. He has also taken the Court to the
order passed by this Court in Special Criminal Application No. 1200 of 2003 dated
16.12.2007 in case of Malav A. Bhatt v. State of Gujarat as well as the judgment of the
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Jitubhai Babubhai Patal v. State of Gujarat reported in
2005 (10) SCC 545and the news report dated 17.7.2007 extracting from the web-site
of Ind. Law Communications Private Ltd. Pointing out that the Hon'ble Karnataka High
Court has allowed one petition against the Narco Analysis Test. Shri Trivedi has
submitted that the aforesaid submissions are only to be construed as his own opinion
with a view to assist the Hon'ble Court and may not be construed as opinion and/or
policy of the State.




     08-08-2022 (Page 6 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global University9. Shri R.C. Kodekar, learned APP appearing on behalf of the State has opposed the
present petition. It is submitted that considering the provisions of the Criminal
Procedure Code, more particularly, Sections 156 to 159, the Investigating Agency of the
State has statutory right to investigate the case and Narco Analysis Test and the Brain
Mapping Test and other tests are scientific tests, which are now the part of the
investigation process and therefore, merely because, the petitioner does not give the
consent for the said tests, the Investigating Officer should not be restrained from
conducting such tests which is necessary for the purpose of finding out the truth and to
nab the accused. It is also further submitted that as there were hue and cry made
against the third degree during the investigation such a scientific test is required to be
performed on the accused. It is ultimately for the Investigating Officer and/or the
prosecuting agency to consider the nature of test required for further investigation. It is
also further submitted by him that as held by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in various
decisions, Investigating Agency is the master of the investigation and nobody can
interfere with the same inclusive of the Magistrate till the appropriate report is
submitted after investigation as required and contemplated under the provisions of the
Criminal Procedure Code i.e. Sections 169 and/or 173. It is also further submitted by
him that when after exploring all the options such a custodial interrogation of the
petitioner, etc. when the Investigating Officer is still in dark and is not able to reach to
the accused persons and find out the truth, and the petitioner is not telling the truth for
investigation in the right direction, Brain Mapping Test and Narco Analysis Test of the
petitioner is required and therefore it is requested to dismiss the present application. It
is submitted by him that it is not that straight away the prosecuting agency applied for
no alternative, for further investigation in a right direction, application was given for
Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test of the petitioner. Meeting with the
submission on behalf of the petitioner that the petitioner is charged only for the
offences under Sections 212 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code and for which such
tests are not called for, it is submitted that even as per the learned Counsel appearing
on behalf of the petitioner the nature of the offences alleged is a relevant consideration
and in the present case what is required to be considered is not an allegation with
regard to Section 212 of the Indian Penal Code but further allegations are also required
to be considered. It is submitted by him that the allegations against the petitioner are
that the petitioner has committed offence of harboring and sheltering the two accused
persons who are involved in the serious offence under Sections 302, 394 and 376 and
others of Indian Penal Code. It is submitted that a girl was murdered by the accused
after committing rape upon her and the said accused persons are absconding and the
allegations against the petitioner are that she has harbored and sheltered those two
accused persons. It is submitted by Shri Kodekar that if the Narco Analysis Test and the
Brain Mapping Test are allowed to be performed/conducted upon the petitioner, in that
case, the Investigating Agency might get some clue which can be helpful to the
Investigating Officer/Investigating Agency to further investigate the case and help the
Investigating Officer/Investigating Agency to find out those accused persons. Therefore,
it is submitted that the allegations against the petitioner for the offence under Section
212 of the Indian Penal Code are required to be considered in light of the offence
committed by those persons to whom the petitioner has given shelter and harbor. It is
also further submitted by him that four different High Courts in the country have
considered all the submissions which are made on behalf of the petitioner and have
permitted the Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test upon the accused persons by
observing that it does not violate the protection guaranteed under Articles 20(3) and 21
of the Constitution of India. It is also further submitted by him that it is not required to
be considered at this stage whether the statement of the accused persons which would




      08-08-2022 (Page 7 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universitybe recorded during the course of the Narco Analysis Test can be used against the
petitioner. According to him, that stage has not come and what is evidentiary value of
the statement made during the Narco Analysis Test that is required to be considered
only at the time of trial and/or at the time when the same is likely to be used against
the accused. It is submitted by him that as stated above the requirement of Narco
Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test is only for further investigation of a serious crime.
Under the circumstances, it is requested to dismiss the present application.

10. Heard the learned advocates appearing on behalf of the respective parties.

behalf of the rival parties, it is required to be considered that what are the Brain
Mapping Test and Narco Analysis Test and the safeguards taken during the aforesaid
tests. At the outset, it is to be noted that what are the aforesaid tests and what are the
safeguards taken at the time of performing/conducting of the aforesaid tests are already
considered by the Bombay High Court, Karnataka High Court and Andhra Pradesh High
Court. The learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the State and the learned Advocate
General have also produced on record certain materials what are the aforesaid tests and
which measures/safeguards are undertaken while conducting/performing the aforesaid
tests and considering the above, it is found as under:

    NARCO ANALYSIS TEST:

        The Narco Analysis Test is conducted by administrating 3 gms of
        Sodium Pentathol or Sodium Amytal dissolved in 3000 ml of distilled
        water depending upon the person's sex, age, health and physical
        condition and this mixture is administered intravenously along with
        10% of dextrose over a period of 3 hours with the help of an
        anaesthetist. The rate of administration is controlled to drive the
        accused slowly into a hyponotic trance. The effect of the bio-molecules
        on the bio-activity of an individual is evident as the drug depresses the
        central nervous system, lowers blood pressure and slows the heart
        rate, putting the subject into a hypnotic trance resulting in a lack of
        in the presence of the doctors. The revelations made during this stagecy
        are recorded both in video cassettes. The report prepared by the
        experts is what is used in the process of collecting evidence. Under the
        influence of the drug the subject talks freely and is purportedly
        deprived of his self-control and will power to manipulate his answers.
        The underlying theory is that a person is able to lie by using his
        imagination. In the Narco Analysis Test, the subject's imagination is
        neutralized and reasoning faculty affect by making him semi-conscious.
        The subject is not in a position to speak up on his own but can answer
        specific and simple questions. In this state it becomes difficult for him
        to lie and his answers would be restricted to facts he is already aware
        of. His answers are spontaneous as a semi-conscious person is unable
        to manipulate his answer. Injected in continuous small dosages it has a
        hypnotizing effect on a person whop responds loquaciously when
        questioned. The ECG and blood pressure are monitored continuously
        throughout the testing procedure. The entire conduct of the procedure
        is video graphed. The questions are designed carefully and are
        repeatedly persistently in order to reduce the ambiguities during drug
        interrogation. After the Narco examination is over the suspect is made




      08-08-2022 (Page 8 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University        to relax for 2 - 3 hours.

    WHAT IS BRAIN MAPPING TEST:

        The Brain Mapping Test is also known as P-300 test. In this test of
        Brain Mapping the suspect is first interviewed and interrogated to find
        out whether he is concealing any information. The activation of brain
        for the associated memory is carried out by presenting list of words to
        the subjects. There are three types of words in the list used for Brain
        Mapping test, Part-I consisted of neutral words, which have no direct
        related to the case and suspects to elicit concealed information, which
        all suspects have had opportunity to come to know during the course of
        events related to the case. Part-III consists of target, which are not part
        of the first two parts. The words in this part are based on confidential
        findings which suspect does not know. The recording of this test is
        done by acquiring the response through 32 channel EEG-ERP Neuro
        Scan cording system. It is carried out by asking the suspect to sit down
        and close his eyes. The 32 channel electrodes are placed over the scalp
        directly. While conducting this test twice by presenting each word in
        three parts randomly. The suspect is instructed to relax and listen to
        the words presented in the auditory mode. This test does not expect
        any oral response from the witness. The conclusion drawn by the
        experts after the conduct of the test to indicate the possession of the
        knowledge about the relevant subject which is helpful in the
        investigation and collection of evidence. After the administration of the
        test, what comes out is that, the person undergoing the test has the
        knowledge of the crime about which he was questioned (brain
        mapping). In the said test there is no way to find out what the lie is or
        what is the information stored in the brain of the person concerned. It
        can be called the information received of taken out from the witness.

12. Need for narco analysis test and brain mapping test and the advantages of the
aforesaid tests:
    The field of criminology has expanded rapidly during the last few years and the
    demand for supplemental methods of detecting deception and improving the
    efficiency of interrogation have increased concomitantly. The Investigating
    Agency has statutory right to investigate the crime and to find out the truth and
    to reach to the accused. Narco Analysis Test for criminal interrogation is
    valuable technique which would profoundly affect both the innocent and the
    guilty and thereby hasten the cause of justice. The Investigating Agency cannot
    be prevented to interrogate the case at the stage of investigation relating to
    crime in which he is shown as accused. If the aforesaid two tests are permitted,
    it would assist the Investigating Agency in finding out the truth and find out the
    real culprit of the commission of an offence. When the Investigating Agency is
    absolutely in dark and after all efforts and exhausting all the alternatives still
    there is no further headway in the investigation, the aforesaid two tests would
    help the Investigating Agency to further investigate the crime and during the
    course of the aforesaid two tests and/or after completion, the Investigating
    Agency may get some clue and may be able to further investigate the crime and
    reach to the real accused/culprit who has committed offence. Accusations are
    made against the Investigating Officer using third degree methods to extract




      08-08-2022 (Page 9 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University    information from the accused and therefore there is a need to have such
    scientific tests. The scientific tests like polygraph test; P-300 test are like taking
    MRI or CT Scan and when the accused are not coming forward with the truth,
    the scientific tests are resorted to by the Investigating Agency to find out the
    truth and to have a further clue in the matter to further investigate the crime.
    Such scientific tests are prayed only as a last resort after exploring all the
    alternatives and when the Investigating Agency is not in a position to reach the
    accused and find out the truth. If the nature of the offence alleged to have been
    committed by the accused coupled with the circumstances under which it is
    committed affords reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of the
    person will afford evidence as to the commission of the offence then such tests
    are necessary. It is a right of the Police Officer under the provisions of the
    Criminal Procedure Code to investigate the crime and collection of the evidence
    by the Police Officer is permissible under the law. Conducting of Narco Analysis
    Test and Brain Mapping Test on the accused are in process of collection of such
    evidence by the Investigating Agency. Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure
    Code enables the police to examine the accused also during the investigation. It
    is the duty of every person to furnish information regarding offence and it is the
    duty of every citizen/person to assist the State in detection of crime and
    bringing the criminals to justice. It is a statutory duty of every witness/person,
    who has knowledge of the commission of the crime to assist the State in giving
    evidence. The investigation of the crime on the scientific line is to help the
    Investigating Agency so as to enable collection of evidence to prove the guilt or
    requires modern scientific methods of crime detection, lest the public goty
    unprotected.

1 3 . Now, considering above, what is required to be considered is whether
conducting/performing of the Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test upon the
accused infringe the constitutional protection guaranteed under Articles 20(3) & 21 of
the Constitution of India or may tantamount to testimonial compulsion and/or would
amount to compulsive testimony.

14. Identical question came to be considered by the Division Bench of the Bombay High
Court in case of Ramchandra Ram Reddy (supra) and after considering the entire
scheme and provisions of Article 20(3) and Article 21 of the Constitution of India and
the nature of the tests and the use of the said tests, the Division Bench of the Bombay
High Court has held that so far as Brain Mapping Test - P300 test is concerned,
protection given by Article 20(3) cannot be made applicable as there will not a
statement during such test and the same cannot said to be incriminatory in nature. So
far as conducting/performing of the Narco Analysis Test is concerned, it is held by the
Division Bench of the Bombay High Court in the said decision that the statement which
is recorded during the course of the Narco Analysis Test unless it is shown to be
incriminating the person making it, it does give rise to the protection under Article
20(3) of the Constitution of India and as and when the Investigating Agency uses such
statement as evidence, the said contention is required to be considered. The relevant
observations of the Division Bench in the said decision are as under:
    Para - 20 : We have therefore no hesitation in holding that Brain Mapping/P-
    300 or Lie Detector/Polygraph tests can be administered to any accused or a
    witness. There is no statement coming out of the involuntary tests, and the
    conclusions which come out of such tests are not statements, the conclusions
    are not proved in any manner to be even likely to be incriminating to the maker




     08-08-2022 (Page 10 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universityof it, the expert can very well depose as an expert in relation to the tests in
court that the Brain Mapping of the accused or the witness discloses existence
of knowledge about a crime in the brain of those persons undergoing the tests.
What that information is nobody is going to say or anybody can say and
therefore there is no question that even the statement coming via expert is
incriminatory. The protection given by Article 20(3) gives protection from
compulsory testimony, it therefore cannot apply to these two tests. We
therefore reject all the contentions in relation to these two tests.

Para - 21 : That takes under Section to the third test which is called as Narco
Analysis (Truth Serum Test). We stated above that in this test the person to
whom it is administered does make a statement as stated above. It undoubtedly
is a statement. The question which falls for consideration therefore, is whether
such statement can be forcibly taken from the accused by requiring him to
undergo the Truth Serum Test against his will. It will be seen that such
statement will attract the bar of Article 20(3) only if it is inculpating or
only after the test is administered and not before. In our opinion therefore,d
there is no reason to prevent administration of this test also because there are
enough protections available under the Indian Evidence Act, under Criminal
Procedure Code and under the Constitution (Article 20(3), to prevent inclusion
of any incriminating statement if one comes out after administration of the test.

Para - 22 : We have to look at this aspect of holding test in a vary broad
prospective. The protection or the cover granted by the fundamental right
appearing in Clause (3) of the Constitution is complete and invariable. The
question is what is sought to be provided by guaranteeing such right and it is
undisputed that what is sought to be protected is the protection of human rights
and dignities. It is also to be considered in the light of other equally important
provisions of the Constitution. Article 51(A) which has been added to the
Constitution by subsequent amendment provides via Clause (1) which says that
it shall be the duty and the duty cannot be properly done by the State, if
unnecessarily large protection is spelt out from other provisions like Article
20(3). Prevention of crime is a sole prerogative of the State and the punishment
of the crime if proved is also the duty of the State. Feters on these duties can
be put only in extreme cases where the protection of fundamental rights weigh
more than the fundamental duty casts on the State. However we need not
further dialate on this aspect for the reason that in our opinion administration
of these tests against the will of the person to whom it is sought to be
administered does not violate the guarantee of Article 20(3) as in the first two
cases it is not a statement and that is not incriminatory in any manner. It is the
last case where it is a statement and unless it is shown to be incriminating to a
person making it, it does not give rise to the protection under Article 20(3). The
petitions are premature in relation to the third test. In so far as the first two
tests are concerned as aforesaid these tests do not violate any protection.
Para - 23 : It will be seen that in our opinion the first two tests do not result in
any incriminating material, they do not result in any statement containing such
material and, therefore, does not in any way violate Article 20(3). In so far as
the third test is concerned enough protection exists, recourse to which can be
taken if and when the investigating agency seeks to introduce such statement
as evidence. We need not therefore consider the contention in relation to the
time when the right or protection given by Article 20(3) starts. In our opinion,




 08-08-2022 (Page 11 of 22)     www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University    we also need not consider several judgments cited at the bar which relate to
    scope and extent of Article 20(3). The judgment in MANU/SC/0018/1954,
    Sharma's case the Supreme Court laid down what is the extent of guarantee
    under Article 20(3). It was then explained by 11 Judges Bench in Kathi Kalu's
    case what exactly is the protection. The law has been ultimately crystalised by
    the Supreme Court in the case of Nandini Satpathy. In all these cases, what
    came up for consideration, was obviously a statement made by the witness
    which obviously was incriminating and therefore the scope was accordingly
    considered by the Supreme Court of India. In the present case we have came to
    the conclusion that it is not a statement in relation to the first two tests and in
    relation to the third test it is a statement entry of which in evidence is
    adequately protected by various provisions of law and therefore we need not
    consider this and other cases stated at bar.

15. The aforesaid controversy is also considered by the Karnataka High Court in case of
Smt. Selvi and Ors. (supra) and the Karnataka High Court has also considered the need
considered the submissions made on behalf of the accused that to appear for has also
undergoing Narco Analysis Test would violate his fundamental rights under Article 20(3)
of the Constitution of India and would compel the accused to give evidence against
himself, which is prohibited under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India and after
elaborately considering various provisions of the Constitution of India as well as the
Criminal Procedure Code and considering what are the aforesaid tests and what
safeguards are taken, the Karnataka High Court has permitted to conduct/perform the
Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test on the accused. The relevant observations
of the Karnataka High Court in the said decision are as under:

    It was vehemently argued for the accused that the learned Magistrate
    committed a serious and grave error in giving directions to the accused to
    appear for undergoing Narco-analysis Test as the same violates their
    fundamental right guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution. According
    to him, the order containing the directions given is nothing but compelling the
    accused to give evidence against themselves, which is prohibited under said
    Article 20(3) of the Constitution.

    Para - 7 : The term narco-analysis was introduced in 1936 for the use of
    narcotics to induce a trance like state wherein the person is subjected to
    various queries. The material (literature) produced shows that in the Narco-
    analysis Test conducted under medical supervision, an accused will be injected
    with Sodium Pentathol or Sodium Amytal and thereafter the accused will be
    expert doctors. But, this will be only after carrying out a detailed medical
    examination of the accused. If accused is found medically fit to undergo the
    procedure, then only it will be done, otherwise not. After finding an accused
    medically fit to undergo the test, the accused will be administered small doses
    of intravenous infusion of sodium pentathol.

    Para - 8 : Sodium Pentathol is the most commonly used drug as an induction
    agent for general anesthesia routinely contemplated in most of the surgeries
    and the psychiatrists routinely use sodium pentathol in the diagnosis of mental
    illness and/or to evaluate the psychological realities. Under the influence of the
    drug, the patient talks freely and is purportedly deprived of his self-control and
    will power to manipulate his answers. This is because, few drugs are known to




     08-08-2022 (Page 12 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityrelax individual's defence so that unknowingly the person reveals the truth,
which he has been trying to conceal.

Para - 9 : So, during the search for effective aids to interrogation, which is
probably as old as man's need to obtain information from an unco-operative
subject, more recently, police officials in some countries have turned to the
assistance of such drugs in the interrogation of unco-operative accused
persons. The investigating agency uses such drug (of its choice) for getting
information from persons/accused from their subconscious level at which it may
be difficult for accused to lie. This is said to be due to lack of inhibition
produced by the drug and the accused talks freely and respond truthfully to
verbal questions. Thus, the use of such drug in police work/interrogation is
similar to the accepted psychiatric practice of Narco-analysis and the only
difference in the two procedures is the difference in the objectives. But the
question is, whether, as a scientific technique in investigations, Narco-analysis
Test on an accused could be permitted? In other words, the issue is, whether
Narco-analysis Test amounts to compulsion?st his consent or wishes during

Para - 11 : It was vehemently argued for the accused that administering i.e.,
injecting the drug to accused without their consent or against their wishes
amounts to ""compulsion"" attracting Article 20(3) as it causes injury, may be
slight.

Para - 12 It is true that causing some pain by injecting drug may technically
amount to hurt as defined under Section 319 of the Indian Penal Code. But such
pain could be caused even when blood sample is drawn for the purpose of its
test. So also, by the use of emetic when a culprit is suspected to have
swallowed some stolen article. However, for such purposes, the law permits use
of necessary force, as is clear from Section 53(1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure, which is as under:

    53. Examination of accused by medical practitioner at the request of
    committing an offence of such a nature and alleged to have been
    committed under such circumstances that there are reasonable grounds
    for believing that an examination of his person will afford evidence as
    to the commission of an offence, it shall be lawful for a registered
    medical practitioner, acting at the request of a Police Officer not below
    the rank of sub-inspector, and for any person acting in good faith in his
    aid and under his direction, to make such an examination of the person
    arrested as is reasonably necessary in order to ascertain the facts which
    may afford such evidence, and to use such force as is reasonably
    necessary for that purpose.

                                                       (emphasis supplied)
Para - 13 : It appears that under the old Code, there was no specific provision
authorising the police officer under which an arrested person could be
subjected to medical examination without his consent. Therefore with an
intention to remove that lacuna this new provision was incorporated in the new
Criminal Procedure Code, with the sole intention of facilitating effective
investigation. Section 53 authorises investigating machinery to get an arrested
person examined by a medical practitioner. Section 54 confers such a right




 08-08-2022 (Page 13 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityupon the accused himself. This examination is contemplated under certain
conditions. If the nature of the offence alleged to have been committed by the
accused coupled with circumstances under which it is committed affords
reasonable grounds for believing that an examination of his person will afford
evidence as to the commission of the offence, then it has been made lawful for
the registered medical practitioner to act at the request of the Police Officer, not
below the rank of sub-inspector and to carry out examination of the person
arrested in order to ascertain the facts which may afford evidence and for that
purpose to use such force as may be necessary. This examination has to be
carried out by a registered medical practitioner or any person acting in good
faith in his aid and under his direction. It cannot, therefore, be said that merely
because some pain or discomfort is caused (in injecting the drug), such a
procedure (test) should not be permitted.

Para - 15 : It is true in Narco-analysis Test, nothing is extracted from the body
of accused nor anything is compared nor tallied since what is obtained is
information given by an accused will be either exculpatory or inculpatory and it
is only inculpatory statement which is hit by Article 20(3) of the Constitution.
Whether the accused make inculpatory or exculpatory statement will be known
only after the test is conducted and not before that. So, it is premature to say
the nature of statement or information, which the accused give under Narco-
analysis Test.

Para - 16 : Now reference can be had to Section 156(1) of the Code of Criminal
Procedure. It says that any officer-in-charge of a police station may, without
the order of a Magistrate, investigate any cognizable case which a Court having
jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of such station would have
power to inquire into or try under the provisions of Chapter XIII. Admittedly,
the offence punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code is a
cognizable offence. So, said provision comes to the aid of investigating agency
for investigation. ""Investigation"" as defined in Section 2(h) of the Criminal
Procedure Code includes all the proceedings under the Code of Criminal
Procedure for the collection of evidence conducted by a Police Officer or by any
person (other than a Magistrate) who is authorised by a Magistrate in that
behalf. Thus, collection of evidence by Police Officer is permitted under law.
Conducting Narco-analysis Test on accused is in the process of collection of
such evidence by the investigating agency.

Para - 18 : It is true that permission of Court or Magistrate is not necessary for
Criminal Procedure Code. For conducting Narco-analysis Test, the investigating
agency necessarily requires expert Doctors as without that, such test cannot be
conducted. Ordinarily, experts or doctors want an order of the Court when they
have to assist the investigating agency in the investigation. Section 53 of the
Criminal Procedure Code only says that it shall be lawful for a registered medial
practitioner to make examination of an accused when requested by Police
Officer. That apart, the report on polygraphy test, advises to subject the
accused to Narco-analysis Test after obtaining permission from the Court.
Under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, a Magistrate empowered
under Section 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code may order for an
investigation referred to in Section 156(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. So
and when the word investigation includes collection of evidence by the I.O., if




 08-08-2022 (Page 14 of 22)     www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universityan investigating agency had sought permission from the Court without referring
provision, it cannot be termed as unwarranted or bad in law. So, I do not find
any force in the argument advanced for the accused.

Para - 19 : At this stage, reference can also be had to Section 161 of the
Criminal Procedure Code, with specific reference to Section 27 of the Indian
Evidence Act, 1872. In the case of Smt. Nandini Satpathy v. P.L. Dani
MANU/SC/0139/1978, a Bench of three Hon'ble Judges of the Supreme Court
has held that Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Code enables the police to
examine an accused also during investigation. So, questioning accused during
investigation is permissible subject to certain conditions made clear in the said
judgment.
Para - 20 : It cannot be forgotten that Section 39 of the Criminal Procedure
Code casts a duty upon every person to furnish information regarding offences.
Criminal justice system cannot function without the cooperation of the people.
Rather, it is the duty of every person to assist the State in the detection of the
crime and bringing criminal to justice. Withholding such information cannot be
traced to the right to privacy, which itself is not an absolute right. In this
regard, reference can be had to a recent decision of the Supreme Court in the
case of State v. Dharmapal MANU/SC/0260/2003 and observed by the Supreme
Court in the case of State of Gujarat v. Anirudha Singh MANU/SC/0749/1997,
that it is the statutory duty of every witness, who has the knowledge of the
commission of the crime, to assist the State in giving evidence.

Para - 23 : The right guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution is in the
protection of human rights and dignities, which may need consideration in the
light of other equally important provisions of the Constitution. It need not be
said that prevention of crime and punishment for the crime are the duties of the
State. Fetters on these duties can be put only in extreme cases where the
protection of fundamental rights weigh more than the fundamental duty casted
on the State. Section 53 of the Criminal Procedure Code has been brought on
statute book to have efficient and scientific investigation. It is intended to help
the investigation of the crime on the scientific lines so as to enable collection of
evidence to prove the guilt or innocence of the persons accused of committing
the crime as the modern community requires modern scientific methods of
crime detection, lest the public go unprotected. Further, in the process of
obtaining information, i.e., collection of evidence during investigation, if any
legal or fundamental right of the accused is infringed or violated, nothing
prevents them from resorting to the safeguards provided to them under various
laws. But that cannot be a ground to refuse to answer during investigation.
Para - 30 : It was also contended for the accused that the first accused is
suffering from heart problem and as such, subjecting her to undergo Narco-
analysis Test will be detrimental to her health. It may be noted that the accused
1 had undergone Brain Mapping and Polygraphy Tests, admittedly. Further, as
noted already, before subjecting an accused to Narco-analysis Test, his/her
medical fitness will be ascertained and thereafter only accused will be subjected
to Narco-analysis Test. Reference can also be had to the conclusion found in ""A
report on Narco-analysis Test"" submitted by the prosecution under the
signature of the Director of Forensic Science Laboratories (Police Department),
Madiwala, Bangalore, which is as under:





 08-08-2022 (Page 15 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University        It should be unambiguously mentioned at this stage that the dosage
        level required to take a person to the hypnotic stage is found to be 3-4
        times smaller than those required for stages beyond. Therefore, this
        low concentration of the drug used in the Narcosis/Narco analysis will
        not have any adverse effect on any system of the body.

    So, the argument cannot be upheld though, of course, necessary care-
    precaution requires to be taken.

    Para - 31 : It be gain said that test permitted by the impugned order assists the
    commission of the murder of deceased Shivakumar and as such, it may evenfor the
    show innocence of accused. For the aforesaid reasons and discussion made, it
    is held at this stage that the impugned order does not violate the Article 20(3)
    of the Constitution.

In Dinesh Dalmia v. State reported in MANU/TN/8154/2006, the Madras High Court in
paras - 14 and 17 observed as under:

    Para - 14 : Huge amount has allegedly been misappropriated by the accused
    and the investigating agency is completely in the dark as to the end use of such
    a huge amount siphoned off by the accused. The Investigating Officer did not
    use third decree methods to extract incriminating materials through the mouth
    of the accused. Only a scientific test on the accused is prayed for by the
    respondent-complainant. That the accused will face health hazard and his
    physical frame will be endangered if he undergoes such scientific tests are
    totally without any scientific basis. As rightly pointed out by the learned
    Counsel for the respondent, the scientific tests are like taking MRI or CT Scan.
    The scientific value of such tests and the credibility thereof will have to be
    evaluated only during the course of trial. Unless such tests are conducted, the
    Investigating Agency may not be in a position to come out with clinching
    testimony as against the petitioner. Subjecting an accused to undergo such
    scientific tests will not amount to breaking his silence by force. He may be
    such tests is quite voluntary. Therefore, such process does not amount toon during
    compelling a witness to give evidence as against him.

    Para - 17 : As the accused had not allegedly come forward with the truth, the
    scientific tests are resorted to by the Investigating Agency. Such a course does
    not amounts to testimonial compulsion. When there is a hue and cry from the
    public and the human rights activists that the investigating sleuths adopt third
    degree methods to extract information from the accuse, it is high time the
    investigating agency took recourse to scientific methods of investigation. The
    learned Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, has granted
    the relief as prayed for by the respondent herein to secure the ends of justice.
    Therefore, there is no warrant for upsetting the order passed by the Court
    below.

16. Now, in the backdrop of above, it is required to be considered by this Court
whether performing/conducting of the Narco Analysis Test and/or Brain Mapping Test
on the accused by itself would amount to violation of protection guaranteed under
Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. It is also required to be considered that at
what stage the protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India is




     08-08-2022 (Page 16 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universityrequired to be considered. Article 20 of the Constitution of India reads as under:

    Article 20 : Protection in respect of conviction for offences:

        i. No person shall be convicted of any offence except for violation of
        the law in force at the time of the commission of the act charged as an
        offence, nor be subjected to a penalty greater than that which might
        have been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the
        commission of the offence.
        ii. No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence
        more than once.

        iii. No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a
        witness against himself.

    Now, it is the contention on behalf of the petitioner-accused that
    conducting/performing of the aforesaid two tests would be testimonial
    compulsion and these tests, if compelled would amount to compulsion to make
    a statement against himself/herself and therefore, hit by Article 20(3) of the
    Constitution of India. Now, what is the Narco Analysis Test. In the Narco
    Analysis Test, the subject's imagination is neutralized and reasoning faculty
    affect by making him semi-conscious. The subject is not in a position to speak
    up on his own but can answer specific and simple questions. In this state it
    becomes difficult for him to lie and his answers would be restricted to facts he
    is already aware of. The said test is conducted by administrating 3 gms of
    Sodium Pentathol or Sodium Amytal dissolved in 3000 ml of distilled water and
    is administered intravenously along with 10% of dextrose over a period of 3ture
    hours with the help of an anesthetist. The subject is then interrogated by the
    Investigating Agency in the presence of the doctors and as stated above, the
    revelations made during this stage are recorded in both in video cassettes and
    the report prepared by the experts is used in the process of collecting evidence
    and to find out the truth and to further investigate into the crime. It is the user
    of the statement recorded during the course of the aforesaid tests as evidence
    against the accused the question with regard to protection under Article 20(3)
    of the Constitution of India is required to be considered. As rightly observed by
    the Bombay High Court in case of Ramchandra Ram Reddy (supra) in order to
    invoke Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India, the following things must
    happen.

        1. There should be formal accusation of commission of any offence.

        2. The accused of such formal accusation should be compelled to make
        a statement.
        3 . The statement so compulsorily made or evoked or provoked is
        incriminating to the accused or maker thereof.

        4. Result of such statement must be a testimony with these ingredients
        as even though Article 20(3) are established, the protection under
        testimonial compulsion will come into operation.

        Thus, such statement recorded during the course of the Narco Analysis




     08-08-2022 (Page 17 of 22)     www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University        Test will attract bar of Article 20(3) only if it is inculpating or
        incriminating the person making it and the said protection/guarantee is
        required to be considered at the stage when the Investigating Agency
        seeks to introduce such statement as evidence. Therefore, at the stage
        of conducting/performing the Narco Analysis Test, the bar/protection
        guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India is not
        required to be considered and this is not the stage, at which, the
        protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India is
        required to be considered.

17. As stated above, when after exhausting all the possible alternatives to find out the
truth and nab the criminal/accused and when it is found by the prosecuting agency that
there is no further headway in the investigation and they are absolutely in dark, there is
a necessity of such a test. On the basis of revelations and/or the statement recorded
while conducting/performing the Narco Analysis Test, the prosecuting agency may have
some clues which would further help and/or assist the Investigating Agency to further
Constitution of India and merely conducting/performing of a Narco Analysis Test on the the
accused, the protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India is
not violated. As stated above, only and only at the stage when the prosecuting agency
is likely to use such statement as evidence and if it is inculpating and incriminating the
person making it, it will attract the bar of Article 20(3). As rightly observed by the
Bombay High Court in case of Ramchandra Ram Reddy (supra) whether the statement
made during the course of the aforesaid test is inculpating or incriminating the person
making it, can be ascertained only after the test is administered and not before. Thus,
by conducting/performing the Narco Analysis Test itself would not tantamount to
compulsive testimony or testimonial compulsion and the same would not amount to
violation of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India and if the statement recorded
during the course of the aforesaid test is used against the accused, enough protection
exists in the Criminal Procedure Code and/or Indian Evidence Act and recourse to which
can be taken as and when the Investigating Agency seeks to produce such statement as
evidence and merely on apprehension and/or presumption that the said statement could
be used by the Investigating Agency against the person making it that by itself is no
ground not to permit the Investigating Agency to conduct/perform the Narco Analysis
Test upon the accused, more particularly, when the same is needed for the purpose of
finding out the truth and to nab the criminal/accused who have committed offence and
when the Investigating Agency is absolutely in dark. Under the circumstances, there is
no   substance    in  the   contention/submission    of   the   petitioner/accused   that
conducting/performing of the Narco Analysis Test by itself would be taking away the
protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India.

18. So far as Brain Mapping Test is concerned, it is also known as P-300 test. What is
the Brain Mapping Test is already discussed hereinabove. What is received at the
conclusion of such test is indication of the fact that the accused or the suspect does
have or is in possession of knowledge about the subject on which he was questioned.
There no verbal response from the witness. There is no statement coming out of this
and therefore, there would not be bar of Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India so far
as Brain Mapping Test is concerned.

19. There is another reason also in favour of the prayer of the prosecuting agency for
conducting/performing the aforesaid two tests. Under the provisions of the Criminal
Procedure Code, the prosecuting agency is statutorily authorized to investigate the




     08-08-2022 (Page 18 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universitycrime and to find out the truth and to reach to the accused persons who have committed
serious offences, detail investigation is required. Investigating Officer is the master of
the investigation and nobody can restrain and/or interfere with the investigation carried
out by the Investigating Officer, not even the Magistrate till an appropriate report is
submitted by the Investigating Officer as contemplated under the provisions of the
Criminal Procedure Code. Thus, considering the various provisions under the Criminal
Procedure Code right from Sections 156 to 159 and other related provisions, collection
of evidence by the police officer is permitted under the Law. Conducting the aforesaid
tests on accused is to be considered as process of collection of such evidence by the
Investigating Agency. The aforesaid two tests are scientific methods in furtherance of
the investigation. The field of criminology has expended rapidly and new techniques
and methods are used for committing the crimes and offences and the demand for
supplemental methods of detecting deception and improving the efficiency of
interrogation have increased concomitantly. Thus, aforesaid tests for criminal
interrogation is a valuable technique which would help the Investigating Agency to
further investigate the crime when the Investigating Agency finds itself clueless and
there is no further headway in the investigation. The Investigating Agency cannot be
prevented to interrogate the accused at the stage of investigation and restraining the
Investigating Agency to further investigate the crime through the aforesaid two tests
would tantamount to interfere with the right of the Investigating Agency to investigate
the crime of which it is statutorily authorized.
20. Now, it takes me to the next question whether before conducting/performing
aforesaid two tests, the consent of the subject is required? In other words, whether in
absence of consent of the accused person, the aforesaid two tests are permissible? As
held merely conducting of or performing of the aforesaid two tests on the accused
would not take away the protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution
of India and the said aspect is not required to be considered at the time of
performing/conducting the aforesaid two tests and only when the statement which has
been recorded during the course of the Narco Analysis Test, if it is used against the
person as evidence at that stage, the same is required to be considered. Therefore, the
question of consent at the stage of conducting/performing the aforesaid two tests is not
required to be considered. As stated hereinabove, conducting/performing of the
aforesaid tests is a part of investigation and for the investigation by the Investigating
Agency the consent of the accused is not required, otherwise the Investigating Agency
will not be in a position to further investigate the case, if the consent of the accused is
required. At this stage, it is also required to be noted that the accused has not allegedly
come forward with the truth and therefore, scientific tests are resorted to by the
Investigating Agency. When the accused/person has not told the truth during the
investigation, naturally, that accused/person would not be voluntarily giving consent for
the aforesaid tests as he is always apprehensive that if the aforesaid two tests are
conducted than the same might go against him therefore, he is bound to not give
consent. Even it is not expected from a person/accused to give consent for the aforesaid
two tests when he has not come forward with the truth. As stated above, the aforesaid
two tests are the scientific methods of investigation and are the part of investigation.
There is no provision under the Criminal Procedure Code to have the consent of the
accused before or during the investigation. It is also to be noted that before subjecting
the accused to Narco Analysis Test his/her mental fitness will be ascertained and
thereafter only accused will be subjected to Narco Analysis Test. The dosage level
required to take a person to the hypnotic stage is found to be 3-4 times smaller than
those required for stages beyond. Therefore, this low concentration of the drug used in
the said test will not have any adverse effect on any system of the body. Necessary
precautions are always taken by the medical experts at the time of examination and the



     08-08-2022 (Page 19 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universitydoctors   and   anesthetists   and   the   experts   are   present   at   the   time   of
conducting/performing such test. Under the circumstances, the contention on behalf of
the petitioner-accused that before conducting/performing the aforesaid two tests, the
consent of the accused person who will be subjected to the aforesaid tests is required
cannot be accepted and the answer to such question is in negative.

21. Now, so far as reliance placed upon the Law Commission's Report as well as the
guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission are concerned, it appears
that the question which has been considered by the Law Commission was that whether
the aforesaid tests should be made compulsorily for which a provision is to be made in
the Criminal Procedure Code and if such a provision is made in the Code, the protection
guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India would be violated or not. On
considering the entire Report of the Law Commission, it appears that need of the
Investigating Agency to further investigate the crime and to find out the truth has not
been considered and has not been focused. This Court has already discussed
hereinabove the need for such a test by the Investigating Agency and whether
protection guaranteed under Article 20(3) of the Constitution of India. So far as reliance
placed upon the guidelines issued by the National Human Rights Commission is
concerned, as discussed hereinabove, while conducting/performing the aforesaid two
tests due care is always taken by the medical experts and before subjecting the accused
to Narco Analysis Test, his/her medical fitness will be ascertained and necessary care
and precautions are taken by the medical experts at the time of examination.

22. So far as the decision relied upon by the learned Senior Advocate appearing on
behalf of the petitioner-accused are concerned, in view of the discussion hereinabove
and the subsequent amendment in the Criminal Procedure Code, the aforesaid decisions
would not be helpful to the petitioner-accused.

23. Now, so far as the contention/grievance made by the learned advocate appearing
for the petitioner that though it was pointed out before the Revisional Court that the
identical question is pending before the Hon'ble Supreme Court, which is referred to the
Larger Bench and the same has not been dealt with and considered by the Revisional
Court is concerned, at the outset, it is to be noted that such a grievance is not made in
the present petition. There are no pleadings in the petition that the aforesaid
submissions were in fact made but the same has not been considered and/or dealt with
the by the Revisional Court. It might be that in the revision memo such a ground might
have been taken but many a times so many grounds are taken in the memo but they are
not argued and/or submissions are not made before the Court. If such a contention is
raised and argued before the learned Revisional Court and the same has not been dealt
though argued is not considered. Thus, it can be presumed that such a such a submission
contention/submission might have been raised in the memo of revision but might not
have argued. It is true that whenever submissions are made and/or contentions are
raised, the Court is required to consider and deal with the same and it must be reflected
in the judgment that said submissions/contentions has been dealt with. As stated
above, in absence of any grievance made in the petition, the contention of the petitioner
cannot be accepted.

2 4 . As stated above, Shri Nanavati, learned Senior Advocate appearing for the
petitioner - accused has also tried to submit that as the question is pending before the
Hon'ble Supreme Court and is referred to the Larger Bench, performance of the
aforesaid two tests on the petitioner should be refused and/or the present petition be




     08-08-2022 (Page 20 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global Universitykept pending. As stated above, thrice this Court adjourned the matter at the instance of
the learned Senior Advocate appearing on behalf of the petitioner so as to enable the
petitioner to move an appropriate application before the Hon'ble Supreme Court for
transfer of the present proceedings and on the last occasion it was also agreed by the
learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner that if no orders are obtained, he
will proceed further with the matter and make submissions on merits. As stated above,
it is reported that the petitioner is not desirous of submitting an appropriate application
for transfer before the Hon'ble Supreme Court and that is how this Court has taken up
the matter and considered the same on merits. It is also required to be noted that
conducting/performing of the aforesaid two tests are timely requirement, more
particularly during the course of the investigation and even if after the period of 6
months or so and/or after a long time, the said tests are permitted to be performed, the
purpose for which the said tests are required would be frustrated. If the said tests are
not permitted to be performed at an appropriate time and stage, the same would defeat
the purpose for which the said tests are required to be performed i.e. to find out the
truth to reach the real culprit and to further investigate the case. As stated above, there
are so many proceedings pending in the State involving serious offences like
Saurabuddin encounter case and the murder of his wife Kausharbibi and others. Where
the questions with regard to conducting/performing of the aforesaid two tests are
involved and in some cases the Investigating Agency have found themselves in dark and
clueless, there is necessity of conducting the aforesaid tests and the proceedings are
pending at different stages before the different Courts i.e. either at the stage of learned
Magistrate and/or Revisional Court and/or before this Court and therefore, this Court
has considered the case on merits.
25. Now, so far as the contention on behalf of the petitioner that as such, the petitioner
is charged only for the offences under Sections 212 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal
Code which are trivial in nature and therefore, looking to the offences alleged, such a
drastic tests are not required and the contention that the nature of offences alleged is
also relevant consideration is concerned, it is required to be noted that the allegations
against the petitioner are that the petitioner has committed offence of harboring and
sheltering the accused persons who have committed murder and rape of a girl and that
the further allegations are of criminal incrimination and abetment, therefore, the
question is not of harboring and/or sheltering an ordinary accused but what is
important is to which accused the petitioner has harbored and sheltered. Therefore, the
contention on behalf of the petitioner that as the allegations against the petitioner are
only for the offences under Sections 212 and 506(2) of the Indian Penal Code and the
nature of offences are such which does not warrant such tests, cannot be accepted.
Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the petitioner is right in making submissions
that the nature of offence alleged is a relevant consideration and the method adopted in
commission of crime by one or more accused is also a relevant consideration for such
tests.

26. For the reasons stated above, it cannot be said that the learned Magistrate has
committed any error and/or illegality in allowing the application of the prosecuting
agency for conducting of the Narco Analysis Test and Brain Mapping Test upon the
in confirming the said order. Under the circumstances, the present petition is required
to be dismissed which is filed under Article 227 of the Constitution of India as there is
no jurisdictional error much less an error of law committed by both the Courts below.
Accordingly, this petition is dismissed.

The petitioners, the husband and wife, have moved this petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution with manifold prayers. In the course of hearing, Mr. Colin Gonsalves,
learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, has restricted his argument to
prayer (g) which pertains to issue of direction for constituting a medical board to assess
the pregnancy of the 1 st petitioner and direct for termination of the pregnancy.
When the matter was listed on 21.6.2017, the Court took note of the prayer for
appointment of a panel of doctors at a Government hospital in Kolkata to examine the
state of health of the mother and accordingly directed the matter to be listed on
23.6.2017.

When the matter was listed on 23.6.2017, this Court had passed the following order :-

members of the Medical Board. The report of the Medical Board reads as under :-

Finally in pursuance of the Notice of the Director, IPGMER, Kolkata vide Memo N.
Inst./5445 dated 23rd June, 2017, a medical board has been convened at 10.00 am on
27th June, 2017 in the Office Chamber of Dr. S.C. Biswas, Professor of the Department
of Gynae & Obst, IPGMER-SSKM Hospital, in presence of all members of the constituted
Medical Board by the Hon'ble Supreme Court, India. However, Associate Professor Dr.

Acchyut Sarkar, Department of Cardiology was absent. He deputed Dr. Saroj Mondal,
Kolkata The patient, 1st Petitioner of the case Mrs.iologist, IPGMER-SSKM Hospital,

Sarmisth Chakrabortty, 33 years old, w/o Mr.

Anirban Chakrabortty was examined by the Board Members and all the members
expressed their views. Two Gynaecologists, (1) Professor Subhash Chandra Biswas &
(2) Professor Arati Biswas, on good faith examined the patient physically and observed
the following findings: Her L.M.P.-27.12.2016 E.D.D.-4.10.2017 & she is G2Po+1+0+0
Previous pregnancy- she had sudden bleeding P/V & pain abdomen at approximately
seven and half months and delivered in Appolo Hospital, Kolkata, a still born baby
vaginally (as per previous records) in 2015.

On examination- She is conscious and co-operative with profound mental agony.
Her Vitals-stable Per abdominal examination reveals

1. Fundal height of gravid uterus- 24 weeks+ (approx 26 weeks) (Corresponding to
period of amennaorhoea)

2. Liqour-adequate (as per period of gestation)

3. Fetal parts-Palpable
4. F.H.S.+ & Regular Patient, herself spontaneously expressed her wish not to continue
this pregnancy in view of the detected fetal cardiac anomalies so far. On reviewing of
the available records of the patient i.e. U.S.G., Fetal Echo-Cardiography including the
prescription of the attending Obstetrician in Apollo Hospital, Kolkata, the other members
of the Board (Radiologist, Cardiologist, Neonatologist, Pediatric Surgeon and Cardiac
Surgeon) have opined that Å“the fetus has been 7 detected to have cardiac
malformation in the form of Tetralogy of Fallot, Large perimembranous VSD with inlet
extension (bidirectional flow), Aorta from LV overriding the VSD, Pulmonary Atresia,
Duct / MAPCA dependent pulmonary circulation andGood Ventricular function. The
child, if born alive, need complex cardiac corrective surgery stage by stage after birth.
But there is high mortality and borbidity at every step of this staged surgeriesÂ. The
cardiac anomaly has been confirmed by serial investigations.

In view of the above facts and opinion, we, the two Gynaecologists, in good faith like to
opine that the patient is at the threat of severe mentl injury, if the pregnancy is
continued.

Therefore, if the patient wants termination of this pregnancy, she may be allowed with
prior informed consent of inherent risk of her health for procedural inventions, because
there is additional risk of termination of the pregnancy once it is beyond 20 weeks as
the present case is. However, this is a special case and conclusion has been drawn on



      08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 5)     www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityits individual merits.Â On a perusal of the aforesaid report, it is clear as crystal that the
Medical Board is of the view that it is a case for termination of pregnancy, as a special
case. As the last paragraph would show, the Board has mentioned that the patient is at
the threat of severe mental injury, if the pregnancy is continued. It has also opined that
the child, if born alive, needs complex cardiac corrective surgery stage by stage after
birth. But there is high mortality and borbidity at every step of this staged surgeries.

Mr. Gonsalves, learned senior counsel has drawn our attention to two orders, one
passed in Meera Santosh Pal & Ors. vs. Union ofIndia & Ors. [WP (C) No. 17 of 2017
decided on 16.1.2017], wherein this Court, after considering the report of the Medical
Board, has held thus :- Å“Upon evaluation of petitioner no.1, the aforesaid Medical
Board has concluded that her current pregnancy is of about 24 weeks. The condition of
the fetus is not compatible with extra-uterine life. In other words, the fetus would not
be able to survive outside the uterus.
Importantly, it is reported that the continuation of pregnancy can gravely endanger the
physical and mental health of petitioner no.1 and the risk of her termination of
pregnancy is within acceptable limits with institutional back up.Â Learned senior
counsel has also drawn our attention to another order passed in Mrs. X & Ors. vs. Union
of India & Ors. [WP (C)No.81 of 2017 decided on 7.3.2017] wherein this Court had
allowed the termination of pregnancy. The Court had taken the Medical report into
consideration which was to the following effect : Å“There is thus a clear diagnosis of
the condition of the single live fetus which is said to have bialateral renal agenesis
wheich means the fetus has no kidneys and anhydramnios which means that there is an
absence of amniotic fluid in the womb. Further, there is a clear observation that there is
a risk of intrauterine fetal death, i.e. death within womb and there is no chance of a
long term post natal survival.

What is important is that there is no curative treatment available at present for bilateral
renal agenesis.

The Medical Board has opined that thecondition of the fetus is incompatible with extra-
uterine life, i.e. outside the womb because prolonged absence of amniotic fluid results
in pulmonary hypoplasia leading to severe 4 respiratory insufficiency at birth.
From the point of view of the petitioner the report has observed risk to the mother since
continuation of pregnancy can endanger her physical and mental health.

Mr. A.K. Panda, learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India has drawn our
attention to two other orders, one passed in Savita Sachin Patil & Ors. vs. Union of
India and Ors. [WP (C)No.121 of 2017 decided on 28.02.2017] and another in Sheetal
Shankar Salvi & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors. [W.P. No.174 of 2017 decided on
27.3.2017]. In the case of Savita Sachin Patil, theCourt declined to grant permission by
holding, thus : Å“As regards the prognosis, the said medical report clearly does not and
possibly cannot, observe that this particular fetus will have severe mental and physical
challenges. It states that the Å“baby is likely to have mental and physical challenges.Â
In the earlier part of the said medical report, there is no observation made by the
aforestated Medical Board that every baby with Down Syndromehas low intelligence,
but it was observed that Å“intelligence among people with Down Syndrome is variable
and a large proportion may have an intelligence Quotient of less than 50 (severe mental
retardation)Â.
In any case, it is not possible to discern the danger to the life of petitioner no.1 in case
she is not allowed to terminate her pregnancy.




      08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 5)     www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityIn the facts and circumstances of the case, it is not possible for us to grant permission
to petitioner no.1 to terminate the life of the fetus.

In view of the above, as it presently advised, we decline the prayer (a) of the
petitioners for directing the respondents to allow Petitioner No.1 to undergo medical
termination of the pregnancy.Â In Sheetal Shankar Salvi, after perusing the report, the
Court observed that there is no danger to mother's life and the liklihood that the baby
may be born alive and survive for variable period of time, and, therefore, it would not
be appropriate to allow the petitioner No.1 to undergo medical termination of her
pregnancy.
The orders which have been referred to by Mr. Panda, in our considered opinion, rest on
their own facts. Frankly speaking, cases of this nature have to rest on their own facts
because it shall depend upon the nature of the report of the Medical Board and also the
requisite consent as engrafted under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.

In the instant case, as the report of the Medical Board, whichwe have produced, in
entirety, clearly reveals that the mother shall suffer mental injury if the pregnancy is
continued and there will be multiple problems if the child is born alive. That apart, the
Medical Board has categorically arrived at a conclusion thatthe in a special case of this
nature, the pregnancy should be allowed to be terminated after 20 weeks.

In the case of Suchita Srivastava & Anr. vs. Chandigarh Administration [(2009) 9 SCC
1), the Court has expressed the view that the right of a woman to have reproductive
choice is an insegregable part of her personal liberty, as envisaged under Article 21 of
the Constitution. She has a sacrosanct right to have her bodily integrity. The case at
hand, as we find, unless the pregnancy is allowed to be terminated, the life of the
mother as well as that of the baby to be born will be in great danger. Such a situation
cannot be countenanced in Court.
Regard being had to the aforesaid and keeping in view the report of the Medical Board,
we are inclined to allow the prayer and direct medical termination of pregnancy of the
1st petitioner at the IPGMER-SSKM Hospital.The termination procedure to be carried
out forthwith by the competent authorities of the IPGMER-SSKM Kolkata. For the sake of
clarity, we may hasten to add that Mr. Gonsalves, upon obtaining instructions, has
agreed for the said hospital. When we say, 'carried out forthwith' it depends when the
1st petitioner and her husband go to the hospital, it shall be conducted without any
delay.

Accordingly, the Writ Petition is disposed of.

The Court after elaborate discussion concluded :

(1) A matrimonial court has the power to order a person to undergo medical
test.

(2) Passing of such an order by the Court would not be in violation of the
right to personal liberty under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.

(3) However, the Court should exercise such a power if the applicant has a
strong prima facie Â case and there is sufficient material before the Court. If
despite the order of the Court, the respondent refuses to submit himself to
medical examination, the Court will be entitled to draw an adverse inference
against him.

In certain cases, medical examination by the experts in the field may not only
be found to be leading to truth of the matter but may also lead to removal of
misunderstanding between the parties. It may bring the parties to terms.




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 24)  www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global UniversityIn matrimonial disputes, the Court has also a conciliatory role to play--even
for the said purpose it may require expert advice.

Under Section 75 (e) of Code of Civil Procedure and Order XXVI, Rule 10A, the
civil court has the requisite power to issue a direction to hold a scientific,
technical or expert investigation.

The question as to whether a person is mentally ill or not although may be a
subject-matter of litigation, the Court having regard to the provisions
contained in Order XXXII, Rule 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Section 41
of the Indian Lunacy Act as also for the purpose of judging his competence to
examine as a witness may issue requisite directions. It is, therefore, not
correct to contend that for the aforementioned purposes, the Court has no
power at all. The prime concern of the Court is to find out as to whether a
person who is said to be mentally ill could defend himself properly or not.
Determination of such an issue although may have some relevance with the
determination of the issue in the lis, nonetheless, the Court cannot be said to
be wholly powerless in this behalf. Furthermore, it is one thing to say that a
person would be subjected to test which would invade his right of privacy and
may in some case amount to battery ; but it is another thing to say that a
party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so
as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the
examined by a properly qualified psychiatrist. For the said purpose, it may not
be necessary to submit himself to any blood test or other pathological tests.

If the Court for the purpose envisaged under Order XXXII, Rule 15 of Code of
Civil Procedure or Section 41 of the Indian Lunacy Act can do it suo motu,
there is no reason why it cannot do so on an application filed by a party to the
marriage.

Even otherwise, the Court may issue an appropriate direction so as to satisfy
himself as to whether apart from treatment, he requires adequate protection
inter alia by way of legal aid so that he may not be subject to an unjust order
because of his incapacity. Keeping in view the fact that in a case of mental
illness, the Court has adequate power to examine the party or get him
examined by a qualified doctor, therefore, it was clear that in an appropriate
case the Court may take recourse to such a procedure even at the instance of
the party to the lis.

Furthermore, the Court must be held to have the requisite power even under
Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to issue such direction either suo
motu or otherwise which, according to him, would lead to the truth.

In all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the ground of
impotency, schizophrenia.... etc. normally without there being medical
examination, it would be difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the
allegation made by his spouse against the other spouse seeking divorce on
such a ground, is correct or not. In order to substantiate such allegation, the
petitioner would always insist on medical examination. If respondent avoids
such medical examination on the ground that it violates his/her right to




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 24) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityprivacy or for a matter right to personal liberty as enshrined under Article 21
of the Constitution of India, then it may in most of such cases become
impossible to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on which
divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to privacy
specifically conferred by Article 21 of the Constitution of India and with the
extensive interpretation of the phrase ""personal liberty"" this right has been
read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as absolute right. What is
emphasized is that some limitations on this right have to be imposed and
particularly where two competing interests clash. In matters of aforesaid
nature, where the Legislature has conferred a right upon his spouse to seek
divorce on such grounds, it would be the right of that spouse which comes in
conflict with the so-called right to privacy of the respondent. Thus, the Court
has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing the interests
involved.

If for arriving at the satisfaction of the Court and to protect the right of a
party to the lis who may otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting his
own interest, the Court passes an appropriate order, the question of such
action being violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India would not
arise. The Court having regard to Article 21 of the Constitution of India must
also see to it that the right of a person to defend himself must be adequately
protected.

Abdul Khadar, 2nd Addl. Senior Civil Judge & JMFC
1. This case is registered by New Town Police Station against the accused persons for
the alleged offence punishable 304-A, 202 R/w Sec. 34 of IPC.

2. The brief facts of the case of the prosecution is as under:

    On 12-10-2014 at about 1.00 p.m. within the jurisdiction of the New Town
    Police Station at J.P. Nagar Shusrut Nursing Home belongs to Sri Biradar, the
    sister of CW.1 by name Smt. Sampavathi went to the hospital by walk and
    admitted for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy operation. The Accused
    No. 1 to 3 have conducted the operation to the deceased Sampavathi without
    maintaining the ventilator facility in the hospital of accused No. 1 and also not
    followed the pre-operation procedures for a period of 5 hours and they have
    not given any intimation about her health condition to the CW.1 to 3 and 7 to
    13. Thereafter the accused No. 1 to 3 are shifted the deceased Sampavathi to
    the hospital of accused No. 4 as there is no facility of ventilator support and
    intensive care unit in the hospital of accused No. 1 and the accused No. 4 get
    admitted the deceased Sampavathi in his hospital at about 10.00 p.m., with an
    intention to screening the accused No. 1 to 3 from their negligent act and made
    5-00 a.m., to the CW.1 to 3 on 13-10-2014, even though she died before that.
    Therefore the accused No. 1 to 3 have committed gross negligence while
    conducting the operation and accused No. 4 intentionally made omission to give
    information to the CW1 to 3. In this regard the brother of deceased
    Sampavvathi lodged complaint on 13-10-2014 at about 8.45. a.m., before the
    New Town police against the Accused No. 1 to 4. CW.24 on receiving the
    written complaint from the C.W.1 he registered case in their Crime No.
    315/2014 for the offences punishable U/S. 304(A) and 202 R/w 34 of IPC and
    preferred the FIR sent it to the Court and his superior officers and set the
    criminal law into motion.

3. On the same day CW.24 visited the Shusrut Nursing Home and Biradar Hospital, at
about 10.30. a.m., he shifted the dead-body of Sampavathi to the Government Hospital,
Mortuary in ambulance and filed requisition to CMO Sujatha requesting her to keep the
dead body in the mortuary. On the same day he conducted inquest panchanama of
deceased Sampavathi in the presence of CW. 4 to 6 at about 11-00 a.m., to 1 p.m. at
that time he noticed that on the stomach of deceased 2 inches 4 holes are found.
Therefore, he send the dead-body to the postmortem through P.C. 1080 and with a
requisition and after postmortem, he handed over the dead-body to the relative of the
deceased Sampavathi. On the same day at about 4. p.m. to 5 p.m. he conducted spot
mahazar in the presence of C.W. 2 and 3 at Biradar Hospital. On 14-10-2014 he
recorded the statement of CW.2, 3 and 7 to 13. On the same day he issued notice to
Accused No. 1 calling her to produce treatment particulars of deceased Sampavathi and
accused No. 1 furnished the details as sought by along with copy of bail order to him
and he received the same and kept in the record. He handed over the case records to




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global UniversityCW.25 for further investigation. CW.25 in his investigation received the Postmortem
Report and also sent the Vishra which are collected at the time of postmortem to the
FSL through CHC 644 and received the acknowledgement from the CHC 644 and
received the FSL report and also wrote a letter to the Superintendent of BRIMS to know
the cause of death of Sampavathi dated 23-02-2015, 02-03-2015 and received the final
opinion of expert on 06-03-2015 for cause of death and kept the same in the file. On
the same day he received the case sheet of Shree Hospital again he wrote a letter to
District Government Surgeon give opinion where the accused No. 1 to 4 committed
gross negligent to provide treatment to the deceased Sampavathi. On 12-01-2016
Medial Superintendent submitted committee members opinion and received final opinion
from the medical Superintendent on 29-04-2016 and after completion of the
investigation, he filed the Charge Sheet against the Accused No. 1 to 4.

4 . After fling of charge sheet, this court was taken cognizance for the offenses
punishable under section 304A, 202 r/w 34 of I.P.C. After service of summons the
accused have appeared through their counsel, before this court and they are released on
under section 207 Cr.P.C. and by securing Accused the accusation for the offencested
punishable under sections 304A, 202 r/w 34 of I.P.C. were framed and read over to
him, he pleaded not guilty and claims to be tried.

5 . In order to establish the alleged guilt of the accused, the prosecution in all has
examined 11 witnesses at PW1 to 11 and got marked 34 documents as per Ex. P1 to
P34. By confrontation during the course of cross examination marked 5 documents at
Ex. D1 to D5. After closure of evidence of the prosecution, the accused were examined
as contemplated u/s. 313 Cr.P.C. and their statement was recorded. The accused have
totally denied the case of the prosecution and in defense Accused No. 3 himself
examined as DW1 and marked 3 documents at Ex. D1 to D3.

6. Heard on both the sides.

7. The following points would arise for my consideration are:
    1. Whether the prosecution proves beyond all reasonable doubts that, on 12-
    10-2014 at about 1 p.m. the deceased Sampavathi went by walk along with
    C.W. 1 to 3, 7 to 13 to the Hospital of Accused No. 1 by name Sushruth Nursing
    Home for laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy operation where the
    accused No. 1 to 3 without maintaining ventilator facility and not following pre-
    operation procedure by negligently conducted operation for a period of 5 hours,
    thereafter she has been shifted to accused No. 4 hospital without intimating the
    health condition of deceased to her family members and she died due to
    complications of Laparoscope assisted Vaginal Hysterectomy and thereby the
    accused No. 1 to 3 have committed the offence punishable U/S. 304-A R/w 34
    of IPC?

    2. Whether prosecution further proves beyond all reasonable doubt that on the
    above said date, time and place, the accused No. 4 with an intention to
    screening the act of accused No. 1 to 3 made disappearance of evidence of
    offence and thereby the accused No. 4 has committed the offence punishable
    U/S. 202 R/w 34 of IPC?
    3. What Order?

8. My findings to the above points are:




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global University                                       REASONS

Point No. 1 and 2-
9. As point Nos. 1 and 2 are interlinked each other and discussion of one point has its
direct bearing on the discussion of another point. Hence, for the purpose of brevity and
convenience and with a view to avoid repetition of discussion of evidence, I discuss
these points jointly.

10. In so far as the oral evidence are concerned prosecution has examined as many as
11 witnesses as per PW1 to PW11. PW1 Veershetty is the Spot Mahazar Witness, PW.2
Jagannath is the complainant, P.W.3 Vijaykumar is the Inquest Mahazar Witness, P.W.4
Ghaleppa is the husband of deceased Sampavathi, P.W.5 Dr. Sunil who conducted the
postmortem of deceased Sampavathi, P.W.6 Dr. Shivakumar Shetkar, who given final
opinion for the cause of death of deceased Sampavathi, P.W.7 Dr. Madana Vaijinath and
P.W.10 Dr. Sangamesh Kunkeri are the member of committee formed by the P.W.6 and
they given their individual opinion for the cause of death of deceased Sampavathi.
P.W.8 Dr. Uma Deshmukh who given finding regarding the case sheet of Shusrut and
Shree Hospital. P.W.9 is the ASI Madappa who registered the case and partly
investigated the case. P.W.11 Santhosh L.T. P.S.I., who investigated the case and
submitted the charge sheet against the accused persons. The documents Ex. P1 to P34
are given in annexures.
11. Let me analyze how for the prosecution is successful in proving the guilt of the
accused to the hilt with the assistance of these oral and documentary evidence.

12. Let me take the evidence of the P.W.1 spot mahazar witness, he deposed that, on
13-01-2014, at about 4 p.m., the New Town police have called him and CW2 and taken
them to the Accused No. 1's hospital, on account of death of Sampavathi who was the
sister of CW.1 as she was died at the time of the operation. The police conducted the
Spot panchanama in their presence and the said spot has been shown by the C.W.1
Jagannath to the police and the spot panchanama conducted inside the operation
theater of Shshrut Nursing Home as the said document is marked at Ex. P1 and he know
the contents of the Ex. P1. He identified his signature and the same is marked at Ex.
P1(a). This witness cross examined by the counsel for the accused in length but nothing
worth while elicited from his mouth to show that he is not present at the time of spot
mahazar and he signed at police station. In the cross-examination he stated that, he
was went to the house of CW7 on he date of incident where police called him to act as
pancha to the spot mahazar. He admits that, the C.W.1 is his relative, the deceased
Sampavathi died on 12-10-2014 and same day conducted the burial of dead body and
he knows the C.W.2. CW7 was the son his elder brother. Hospital consisting one floor
and towards east operation theater is exist Further deposed that at the time of mahazar
himself CW2 and police were present. The police have drawn the Mahazar, but he do
not know the name of police. He denied that, he is not present at the time of drawing of
Spot Panchanama and he signed on the Ex. P1 at Police station. In the cross-
examination of the Accused No. 2, he admits that, he himself and the C.W.7 were doing
tailoring work and at the time of Panchanama, the dead-body was not present in the
hospital. He denied that, himself and the C.W.7 in order to grab the money from the
accused No. 1, they blackmailed and filed this false complaint. He is from Aurad. He



     08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 22)     www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityadmits that, the accused No. 3 is running medical shop inside the hospital. He denied
that, in order to help the C.W.1, he is deposing false evidence. The evidence of PW.1 is
sufficient to prove the spot mahazar in accordance with law.

13. Let me take the evidence of the P.W.2, who is the complainant and brother of
deceased Sampavathi, he deposed that, his sister Sampavathi got married about 30
years back with C.W.7 Ghaleppa. They had two children. She had uterus problem for
that she was taking treatment in the hospital of 1st Accused. On 12-10-2014 at about 1
p.m., his sister went by walk to the accused No. 1 hospital for laparoscopic operation
along with himself C.W. 7 to 10 and admitted her. The Doctors told him that they would
conduct operation at about 4-00 p.m. and they demanded Rs. 25,000/- treatment

     08-08-2022 (Page 5 of 22)     www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global UniversityHe admits that, at the time of operation, the doctors have taken the patient inside the
operation theater. He admits that, at the time of the Panchanama, the Police have not
seized any articles inside the operation theater. He denied that, the Mallkarjun
Kamashetty, Yogesh Kamashetty have conducted the operation and the accused No. 1
was not present at the time of operation. He admits that he has not mentioned the name
of accused No. 2 in his further statement. He admits that C.W. 2, 7 to 13 are present at
the time operation. He denied that, in order to claim compensation before the consumer
forum, they have filed a false complaint against the accused persons.

15. He also denied that, he is deposing false since the accused No. 1 not did the
operation of deceased Sampavathi. He pleads ignorance that, before two years back, his
sister suffering from laparoscopic disease and his brother-in-law not stated that, he is
showing his sister in the hospital of 1st Accused since two years. He admits that, before

admitted on 12-10-2014 for operation as per the say of accused No. 1 and she did
operation with the assistance of accused No. 3 by taking consent from the husband of

an intention to grab the money form the accused he filed false complaint against them
and he had special interest in this case, as the claim petition is pending in the
Consumer Forum and hence the evidence of PW2 is not trustworthy. No doubt the

not at the initial stage. Hence, the evidence of PW.2 is avail to the case of the
prosecution to prove the negligent act of the Accused No. 1 to 4.

29. Then the evidence of PW.11 Santosh L.T. by oversight PW.11 is typed as PW.10 in
the deposition, who is the Investigation Officer, has deposed that, he has received the
case records on 15-10-2014 from C.W.24 and verified the case records and received the
PM Report and sent the Vishra to FSL to CHC 644 and received the FSL Report and wrote

and also received the case sheet of Shree Hospital and written a letter to District

witness cross-examined the learned counsel for the accused, wherein, he admitted the
entire suggestion posed to him. He admits that, in FIR and Complaint, there is no
mention of Accused No. 3 name. In his investigation, he has not found the Accused No.
3 injected the deceased Sampavathi and the Accused No. 3 has not committed any

He falsely implicated the Accused No. 3 has been denied. In complaint and FIR, the
Accused No. 4 name is not found. The deceased Sampavathi was shifted on 12-10-2014
1. One Dr. Rajashekhar Patil provided the ventilator facility to deceased Sampavathi and.
the said Dr. Rajshekhar Patil stated that the Complainant and C.W.7 to call the
Hyderabad doctor for further treatment. The said doctor came and treated her from 2
a.m. to 2:30 a.m. at Shree Hospital on the same day. After examination, he declared
that the patient condition is very serious and he left the patient in Shree Hospital and he
has not recorded the statement of said doctor. On 13-10-2014 at about 5 a.m. the said




     08-08-2022 (Page 14 of 22)   www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global UniversitySampavathi has died as mentioned in the case sheet as per Ex. P13.

The accused No. 3 himself examined as DW.1 and he deposed that he is running
medical and general store at Shusrut Nursing Home Complex since 20 years. There is no
relation to this case. Intentionally he is implicated in this case. He produced License,
Registration Certificate and Ownership Certificate at Ex. D-1 to D-3. Perused already by
confrontation. Ex. D-1 to D-5 already marked on behalf of the accused at the time of
cross-examination. Hence, the Ex. D-1 to 3 have been corrected as Ex. D-6 to 8 instead
of Ex. D-1 to D-3. This witness cross-examined, wherein he stated that, he is residing
at Ujani village, Aurad Taluk before this case as he do now know C.W.1 and 7 and there
is no personal enmity himself and them. He denied that, at the time of operation of
deceased Sampavathi, he was present inside the operation theater and assisted the
doctors. The evidence of D.W.1 and documents produced, it shows that, he is not a
doctor and he is running medical store in the hospital of Accused No. 1. But, the
evidence of P.W.1 and 4 clearly shows that, he was assisted accused No. 1 and 3 at the
time of operation of deceased Sampavathi in the operation theater. The said evidence of
no avail to him to prove his defence.Accused No. 3 and hence, the evidence of D.W.1

30. On perusal of the entire evidence of prosecution it appears that P.W.1 to 4 are the
husband, brother and relative of deceased. It is not disputed fact that, the deceased
Sampavathi admitted to the hospital of accused No. 1 for the purpose of laparoscope
operation and she went to the hospital by walk. It is undisputed fact that before conduct
operation the accused No. 1 examined all pre-operative tests and the said tests reports
were normal. It is undisputed fact that the accused No. 1 and 3 have operated the
deceased and the accused No. 1 to 3 shifted her to the accused No. 4 hospital due to
non availability of ventilator and she died due to complication of anesthesia and
surgery.

31. The learned A.P.P. vehemently argued that, at the time of surgery, the hospital
authority have no I.C.U., ventilator and oxygen facility and before conducting the
surgery, the Accused No. 1 to 3 should have obtained the certificate of patient by
physician and also anesthesia department and got test the blood, X-ray, E.C.G. But in
this case, the Accused No. 1 to 3 have not followed the procedures and also not
obtained the physician certificate and anesthesia fitness certificate before conducting
the surgery. Except Ex. D3, they have not produced any necessary test reports. The
evidence of PW.6 clearly discloses that, at the time of conducting the committee
proceedings, the committee has issued the notice to the parties. The accused No. 1 to 4
are not produced any documents before the committee. Hence, the Accused No. 1 to 3
have not followed the pre-operation procedures and hence this act is negligence on the
admitted the deceased Sampavathi to the hospital of Accused No. 4 at 9:45 p.m. on 12-
10-2014 for ventilator support. This fact clearly goes to show that the Accused No. 1's
hospital had no ICU and ventilator facility. This is also one of the negligence on the part
of the Accused No. 1 to 3. The Accused No. 1 to 3 have conducted a major surgery
hysterectomy under general anesthesia without ensuring that life saving facility and the
availability in their hospital and oxygen care facility in their hospital. The evidence PW.7
shows that, the Accused No. 1 to 3 have commenced surgery at 5 p.m. and not
completed till 9:45 p.m., it shows that, they time passed for four hours in operation
theater. If the Accused No. 1 to 3 have got no knowledge, then they would have called
the other doctors and experts to the hospital of Accused No. 1 for assistance. But, they
have not done so. The evidence of PW.5 shows that, at the time of Postmortem
examination, in Ex. P12, the cause of death is complication of Laparoscope Assisted




     08-08-2022 (Page 15 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityVaginal hysterectomy. After gone through the Postmortem Report, Inquest Report, Case
sheets and FSL Report, the deceased Sampavath died due to complication of
Laparoscope Assisted Vaginal hysterectomy surgery. If the Accused No. 1 to 3 by taking
all precautions, they conducted the operation, the patient would have not died to the
complication. So, it clearly goes to show that, the Accused committed gross negligence
towards deceased Sampavathi. As per the evidence of PW.5, he come to the conclusion
that, there is evidence of Laparoscope Assisted Vaginal hysterectomy and the evidence
of cut and partial cauterized infundibulo pelvic ligaments, encircling sutures then
peritoneum cavity shows the blood clots and fluid blood about 900 m.l. Both the lungs
are grossly congested and edematous because of this complications, the patient was
died. This opinion of the PW.5 shows that, there is gross negligence on the part of the
Accused No. 1 to 3 for that reason, the deceased Sampavathi was died. The P.W.5
evidence also due to cut and partial cauterized infundibulo pelvic ligaments which is
supplied by so many arteries and veins and also there is cutting of the cervix. This goes
to show that, Accused No. 1 to 3 while conducting the surgery negligently cauterized
infundibulo pelvic ligaments as the blood of Sampavathi was lost. Further, P.W.5
evidence also discloses that, due to the problem created by the Accused No. 1 to 3 in
negligent manner while conducting the surgery. This clearly shows that, without taking
any care in negligent manner cut of thereby, the deceased Sampavathi caused loss of
blood committed. It clearly goes to show that, the Accused No. 1 to 3 have committed
gross negligence. In the evidence of P.W.7 shows that, he had gone to the case sheet of
Accused No. 1 hospital, P.M. Report and anesthesia report, he has given opinion of the
cause of death due to bleeding in the peritoneum cavity due to the complication of
during the operation are arrested bleeding was and the said portion was not sutured or
tied bleeding continued in the peritoneum cavity, there was injury to artery and vein
which were not sutured or arrested bleeding will be there continuously unless the
bleeding vessels cot or tied bleeding will be continued in the peritoneal cavity. Further,
patient goes for complication thereby other complication like lungs, kidney, heard and
brain will be affected. There will be collection of water in the lungs then heart is going
to fail slowly and because of that, cutting failure, the brain will not work and because of
that reasons the patient is going to die.

32. Further argued that in the evidence of P.W.8 also due to the pulmonary oedema by
filling the water to the longs, the patient was died. This means there was injury to
artery and vein which were not sutured or arrested bleeding will be there continuously
unless the bleeding vessels cot or tied bleeding is there continuously. It means due to
negligence in cutting and arresting that artery blood was lost, thereby the water was
filled in the lungs. It is held that, there is negligence on the part of the Accused No. 1 to
3. On perusal of the Ex. P29, the opinion of the committee goes to shows that, the
death of deceased Sampavathi was occurred due to complication of anesthesia and
surgery and in the said report also, there is a mentioned that, both anesthesia and
surgeons have struggled maximum to save the life of patient. The Accused No. 1 and 2
are not absolved from their negligence.

33. Further argued that in respect of Accused No. 4 is concerned, he knowing fully well
disappearance of evidence is a negligent to help the Accused No. 1 to 3 and thereby, he
intentionally done the same and hence the provision of Sec. 201 of IPC attracts for the
negligence. The prosecution also argues that, the due to complication of laparoscopic
vaginal hysterectomy and also the death of deceased Sampavathi was occurred due to
complication of anesthesia and surgery by contesting evidence of PW.5 to 7 and the
Accused No. 4 got admitted the deceased Sampavathi to his hospital at 10 a.m. on 12-




     08-08-2022 (Page 16 of 22)    www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global University10-2014. The doctors of Yashodha Hospital, Hyderabad came to the hospital of Accused
No. 4 and at about 2 a.m. on 13-10-2014. As per the Postmortem Report at Ex. P11 and
evidence of PW.5, the death of deceased was occurred 12 to 24 hours prior to
Postmortem. The Postmortem was conducted by the P.W.5 at 1:30 p.m. to 2:30 p.m.
The death of deceased Sampavathi has occurred at about 1:30 a.m. on 13-10-2014 i.e.,
before arrival of doctors from Yashodha Hospital, Hyderabad. The Accused have taken
the defence that, the doctors have conducted the operation carefully and the deceased
Sampavathi died due to some other disease. If deceased Sampavathi died due to some
other reason, then there is no laparoscopic vaginal hysterectomy. P.W.1 to 4 and their
evidence is corroborated each other. If the deceased Sampavathi was died due to some
other disease, definitely, the accused would have lead cogent evidence as per Sec. 106
of Evidence Act. The husband of the deceased was present at the time of operation. He
also stated that, the Accused No. 1 to 3 have taken the deceased Sampavathi to the
operation theater and how much time they took and not calling the other specialists
doctor then the accused No. 1 to 3 have getting complication while conducting
operation and also the Accused No. 4 had given treatment to the dead-body of deceased
Sampavathi. Even the doctor helped in order to rescue the Accused No. 1 to 3 to cause
disappearance and the evidence of PW.1 to 4 also proves that, the Accused No. 2 was
present at time of operation and he was assisting the Accused No. 1 and 3 by calling the
OT doctor and also arrival of the doctor of Hyderabad in conducting the operation. The
P.W.1 and 3 are the pancha witnesses of Spot and Inquest they also support the
prosecution case. It is well settled laws that the prosecution should not stick on to the
statement recorded, he may elicit some importance through the witness in order proper
proper decision. On these grounds, he prayed for conviction of Accused No. 1 to 4 in and
accordance with law.

34. The counsel for the accused No. 1 argued about the maintenance of the hospital
and also argued that, Sec. 304-A has to be proved, when it comes to the medical
negligence, the prosecution has to prove the gross negligence and the recklessness as
mentioned in the land mark judgments and precedents set by the Hon'ble Supreme
Court of India. The prosecution is in confusion between the complications and the
alleged negligence that is gross and recklessness, which are the main ingredients. The
prosecution has to establish beyond all reasonable doubt, the complication were the
result of the alleged gross negligence and recklessness. The accused No. 2 is a
prosecution calling any anesthesia is seeking help and opinion of the specialists and
due to care in the interest of the patient. This goes to how that, the sufficient care and
precautions was taken by the Accused No. 1 which is corroborated by the opinion of the
expert committee report on the cause of death as per Ex. P16 to18. The case sheet of
both hospital and the opinion of the expert committee, FSL Report are going to show
that, there is no any negligence or where the accused have proved the line of treatment
which was not questioned challenged by the prosecution side. As per PW.8 in her cross-
examination states that, the Accused No. 1 is operated doctor and she is a qualified
laparoscopic surgeon, she has been trained at Akola Maharashtra State. She has seen
the certificate of the same which proves that, she is competent and qualified doctor
capable of exercising ordinary skills of Laparoscopic assisted surgery, like hysterectomy
PW 8 in her evidence clearly stated above the requisite skill is processed by the accused
No. 1 to perform the LAVH and the patient developed in operatively acute pulmonary
oedema and she was asked to stop surgery by accused No. 2 and another anesthetist.
The prosecution has failed to prove that complication of pulmonary edema is not likely
to occur during the surgery, which is most important fact and ingredient to prove the
medical negligence. The evidence PW 5, 7, 8 shows that there is a possibility of
pulmonary embolism not only by partial curter of Infundibulo Pelvic Ligaments causing



     08-08-2022 (Page 17 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universitypulmonary edema, which may leads to heart failure. This could be the main reason of
complication, leading death of the patient, not the negligence i.e., gross negligence.
The prosecution has failed to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt that pulmonary
edema caused by the Accused No. 1. If at all, the said complication is not possible to
occur during the performance of LAVH then the case of prosecution could have been
believed. PW 5 admits that PM Report he has not mentioned which ligaments was cut,
as per PM report only one ligament is cut and he is not sure of the specific cut causing
bleeding which leads to pulmonary edema complication. PW 5 further admits that in PM
Report he has not mentioned which artery and vein supplied to the Infundibulo-Pelvic
Ligaments are cut during the surgery, such cutting of ligaments to perform the surgery
is so gross and recklessness amounting to gross negligence. The prosecution also failed
to prove that the presence of blood about 900 ML Fluid, blood clot and blood (not
exactly how much ml. Of blood) leads to the alleged complication and cause of death of
patient. The prosecution also failed to prove that the accused No. 1 has caused to
increase the risk of the patient while performing the surgery. The accused No. 1 taken
sufficient care and attention to reduced the risk of the patient on timely basis and
stopped the surgery ad shifted for better are and management of the patient. The
accused No. 1 hospital is having Manual Ventilator, for better care and attention, was
shifted to the higher center for Mechanical Ventilator. The counsel for the accused
further argued that to prove the negligence the IO has sought the Final Opinion for the
Dist. Surgeon for cause of death. Who constituted an Expert committee of 6 members,
the said committee to commence the enquiry in to the said clarification committee
Member submitted their individual opinion. The committee the given final opinion as per
performance of the LAVH surgery and also shows how the accused have tried to savehe
the deceased Sampavathi. Even the performance of LAVH and its complications were
informed to the concerned and informed-consent was obtained expressly in Ex. D3 in
good faith for the benefit of the deceased Sampavathi to stop the vaginal bleeding,
complication of pulmonary oedema which may be likely to occur/cause during surgery
to the deceased Sampavathi who died due to the said complication, is not and offence
committed by the accuse No. 1. Even PW.8 in her evidence stated that, the requisite
skill is proceeded process by the Accused No. 1 to perform LAVH and the decisions
relied by the prosecution is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present
case on hand the are related to civil liability, not criminal Liability. Further argued that
for every death during medical treatment in medical in medical man can't be proceeded
the against for the punishment the courts were to impose criminal liability on the
hospital and doctors for everything that goes wrong, the doctors would be more worried
about their own safety than giving all the best treatment to their patients. Hence the
prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt which specific complication
was the reason or cause of alleged gross negligence during the LAVH surgery performed
by the accused No. 1. Hence prayed to acquit the accused in accordance with law.

35. The counsel for the accused No. 4 argued that as per the request of the C.W. 1 and
C.W. 7, the Accused 4 over Telephonic message/call informed the doctors of Yashodha
Hospital Hyderabad regarding the patient condition and requested on behalf of CW 7 at
11.00 PM on 12-10-2014. IN response to the Telephonic call of accused No. 4 the
doctors team visited the Shree Hospital with Cardiac Ambulance around to 2:30 A.M. on
13-10-2014, for shifting the patient to Hyderabad, the examined the patient and found
the patient was in critical condition with unstable lacmodynamic parameter and refused
to shift the patient in their cardiac Ambulance to Yashodha Hospital Hyderabad, and
advised to maintained the patient with same treatment. The doctors of Shree Hospital
by informing the patient condition to attainders and form and time to time and
maintained the case sheet. Inspite of several efforts made by Accused No. 4 in coming



     08-08-2022 (Page 18 of 22)    www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityout from the critical condition of the patient who was on the ventilation support patient
health was not supported and lastly at 5:00 A.M. death of Sampavathi was declared on
13-10-2014. And death is 12 to 24 hours prior to Post-Mortem the same as been
admitted by the PW 5 the death might have occurred between 4 to 18 hours. PW 8 in his
evidence stated that death is declared at 5.00 am on 13-10-2014 and the time shown in
PME varies. Under the these circumstances the allegation as against Accused No. 4
regarding suppression of material fact death of Sampavathi much prior to PME 12 to 24
hours is not supported by the document evidence and the evidence adduce by the
prosecution nowhere establishes the fact of is accused No. 1 supported the accused No.
1 to 3. Hence prayed to acquit him in accordance with law.

36. The counsel for the accused has relies the decision of Hon'ble Apex Court reported
in MANU/SC/0610/2021 : (2021) 10 is SCALE 350 in the case of Dr. Harish Kumar
Khurana VS. Joginder Singh and Others wherein held that, where the treatment is not
successful or the patient dies during surgery, it cannot be automatically assumed that
the medical professional was negligent-Indicate negligence there should be material
Negligence alleged should be so glaring, in which event the principle of res ipsa
loquitur could be made applicable and not based on perception. On bare reading of the
cited decision due respect is not applicable to the facts and circumstances of the present
case in hand and the same is delivered on different context.

37. On perusal of oral and documentary evidence produced by the prosecution it is
clearly establishes the fact that the accused No 1 to 3 conducted laparoscopic operation
of deceased Sampavathi by making 4 holes on stomach there was injury to artery and
vein which were not sutured bleeding will be there continuously in the peritoneal cavity
due to which deceased Sampavathi condition goes for other complication like lungs,
kidney, heard and brain will be affected. Moreover there will be collection of water in
the lungs then heart is going to fail slowly and because of that, cutting failure, the brain
will not work and because of that reasons the Sampavathi was dead. The evidence also
discloses that, the accused No. 1 to 3 conducted the surgery and accused No. 4 helped
the accused No. 1 to 3 knowingly the accused No. 1 to 3 have committed an offence,
intentionally omits to give information to the husband and relatives of deceased
Sampavathi which he is legally bound to give. To prove the negligence on the part of
the accused No. 1 to 4 the prosecution has to prove its case through medical evidence
and not required the evidence of independent eyewitness in this case the prosecution by
examining the PW5 to 8 and 10 proved that the accused No. 1 to 3 have operated the
deceased Sampavathi in the hospital of accused No. 1 and the documents at Ex. P11 PM
Report corroborates the evidence of PW1 to 4 regarding the surgical suture wound in at
peri umbilicus region, on right lumbar region, left lumbar region and below injury No. 3
in left region size 2 cms of deceased Sampavathi and the evidence of PW7 also shows
