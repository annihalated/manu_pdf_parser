Facts:

This public interest petition raises very important issues concerning the entire
range of conduct and management, under the auspices of State Governments,
of sterilization procedures wherein women and occasionally men are sterilized
in camps or in accredited centers. The issues raised also include pre-operation
procedures and post-operative care or lack of it. A sterilization surgery does
not appear to be complicated and yet several deaths have taken place across
the country over the years. Undoubtedly, this needs looking into by the
Government of India and the State Governments and remedial and corrective
steps need to be taken. Persons who are negligent in the performance of their
duties must be held accountable and the victims and their family provided for.
It is time that women and men are treated with respect and dignity and not
as mere statistics in the sterilization program.

Sometime in 2005 the issue of sterilization procedures for females and males
under the Population Control and Family Planning program or the Public
Health program of the Government of India came up for consideration before
this Court in a petition filed by Ramakant Rai. The petition was substantially
decided by this Court on 1st March 2005 by passing several directions. The
directions are reported as Ramakant Rai (I) and Anr. v. Union of India and
Ors.

The Petitioner Devika Biswas is a public spirited individual of Araria district in
Bihar. She is a health rights activist with extensive professional experience in
the development and health sectors. What seems to have provoked Devika
Biswas in filing a writ petition Under Article 32 of the Constitution in this




     08-08-2022 (Page 2 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global UniversityCourt is that on 7th January 2012 as many as 53 women underwent a
sterilization procedure in a camp in highly unsanitary conditions in Kaparfora
Government Middle School, Kursakanta, Araria district in Bihar between 8
p.m. and 10 p.m. through a single surgeon. In fact, some of the broad issues
concerning the sterilization camp held on 7th January 2012 as found on
investigation by Devika Biswas, included an absence of pre-operative tests on
the women or proposed patients; they were not given any counseling of any
kind at all; they had no idea about the potential dangers and outcomes of the
sterilization procedure; the sterilization procedures were carried out in a
school and not in a government hospital or a private accredited hospital;
running water was not available at the site; the sterilization procedures were
carried out under torch light with the women being placed on a school desk;
the surgeon did not have any gloves or at least did not change the gloves
available with him; no emergency arrangements were made etc. etc.

Essentially, the entire camp was conducted in unsanitary conditions, in an
unprofessional and unethical manner. What is worse is that the camp was
conducted under the auspices of an NGO called Jai Ambey Welfare Society
who had been granted accreditation by the District Health Society only a few
months earlier that is on 29th November, 2011 apparently without following
any formal and transparent procedure.

As a result of the sterilization camp, many women who were operated upon
Consequently, a series of complaints were filed and they were registered at
Kursakanta Police Station on 8th January 2012. Some of these complaints
were inquired into by the State authorities and it was found that the
sterilization camp was a success except that an expired medicine had been
given to the women. On the other hand, the study and the investigations
carried out by Devika Biswas along with a journalist called Francis Elliott
concluded that the sterilization camp did not meet any of the requirements
laid down by this Court or by the Government of India and that this was
confirmed by the women who were operated upon as well as their relatives.

Devika Biswas then felt compelled to file a public interest litigation in this
Court to ensure that sterilization procedures nationwide are conducted in
accordance with accepted legal norms, medical procedures and the provisions
of the manuals and that those women and men who suffer due to the failure
or complications in implementing the norms, procedures and provisions are
given adequate compensation. That is really the core issue raised by Devika
Biswas and that such instances are not repeated.

Devika Biswas prayed for a series of directions including setting up a
committee to investigate the facts relating to the sterilization camp held on
7th January 2012 and to initiate departmental and criminal proceedings
against those who were involved in the sterilization camp. It is also prayed
that the guidelines given in the manuals prepared by the Government of India
should be scrupulously adhered to so that such incidents do not recur in any
part of the country and if they do, additional compensation should be paid to
the women in distress.

Held, while disposing of the Petition




     08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global University1. In this writ petition, the Court is primarily concerned with the affidavits of
the Union of India, the States of Bihar, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra
and Rajasthan since allegations have been made in respect of sterilization
camps held in these States only. However, during the course of hearing of this
writ petition, allegations surfaced with regard to sterilization camps
conducted in Bilaspur district, Chhattisgarh [between 8th and 10th November
2014] and so the Court is also concerned with the allegations made in respect
of the camps conducted in that State as well.[15]

2. What was brought to Court's notice with regard to the sterilization camps
conducted in Bilaspur district was that as many as 137 women were subjected
to a sterilization procedure and unfortunately 13 of them died. Many others
complained of problems such as vomiting, difficulty in breathing, severe pain
etc. They were taken to nearby hospitals and discharged after necessary
treatment. It appeared that some women who had not undergone a
sterilization procedure also had similar complaints and some of them died
thereby increasing the number of deaths to over 13. Undoubtedly, this was a
matter of great concern brought to Court's notice during the pendency of the
writ petition.[16]

3. Since the proceedings in this case were not adversarial in nature the Court
requested the learned Additional Solicitor General appearing in the matter as
to implement the Standard Operating Procedures and the Guidelines laid how
down by the Union of India in the matter of sterilization procedures.[30]

4. Affidavits have been filed by Union of India and States of Bihar, Kerala,
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh. Devika Biswas
has pointed out in various affidavits filed during the pendency of this writ
petition that the campaign for sterilization is effectively a relentless campaign
for female sterilization. The web portal of the Ministry of Health and Family
Welfare of the Government of India provides statistics on the number of
sterilization procedures conducted in the country for 2012-13. The portal
indicates that 97.4% of all sterilization procedures during this period were of
women. Devika Biswas alleges that the entire family planning program of
Chhattisgarh focuses on female sterilization and the National Health Mission
Project Implementation Plan sets targets for female sterilization and allocates
85% of the family planning budget exclusively to female sterilization.[60]

5. More or less confirming the allegations made by Devika Biswas, the
affidavits filed by Madhya Pradesh, erstwhile Andhra Pradesh and Goa reflect
the fact that the over-whelming number of sterilization procedures is targeted
towards women and there is virtually no attention paid to male sterilization.
[61]

6. Devika Biswas has also pointed out that data released by the Ministry of
Health and Family Welfare during the period 2010-13 shows that at least 363
people have died as a result of sterilization procedures, a very large number
of such procedures have failed and that there have been severe complications
in respect of several persons who underwent a sterilization procedure. This
has resulted in payment of compensation of at least Rs. 50 crores.[62]




     08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University7. The principal problem pointed out by Devika Biswas is with regard to the
implementation of the various processes and guidelines issued by the
Government of India from time to time. Mere issuance of guidelines by the
Government of India does not guarantee their implementation. It is pointed
out (for example) that the list of empanelled doctors is not readily available;
consent forms are not available in the local language except in the Union
Territory of Puducherry; unrealistic targets have been set for sterilization
procedures with the result that non-consensual and forced sterilizations are
taking place, including of persons who are physically or mentally challenged.
Some young persons have been sterilized to meet targets and by and large
illiterate persons are sterilized. Devika Biswas is opposed to setting of targets
and says that she has the support of the Government of India in this regard,
but unfortunately State Governments and Union Territories are still setting
informal targets for sterilization.[63]

8. It is further pointed out that there is inadequate monitoring of sterilization
camps and facilities. There is little or no monitoring in most camps and health
centres, accountability measures are not in place and the rights of thousands
of women who undergo sterilization procedures are violated. It is not enough
for the Government of India to show that it is merely playing a supportive and
facilitative role since the campaign is a national campaign and if it is not
properly implemented, it merely leads to passing the buck with the State
Government blaming the Government of India and vice versa.[64]
9. The strengthening of the Quality Assurance Committees (QAC) and the
District Quality Assurance Committees (DQAC) is crucial to the success of a
family planning program of which sterilization procedures is one of the
elements. Details of the constitution of QACs and DQACs are not available on
the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. There is also no
indication of the steps and decisions taken by them or the minutes of their
meetings or reports submitted by them. In other words, vital information is
simply not available. Devika Biswas doubts whether these Committees meet
on a regular basis although it would be appropriate for them to have at least
quarterly meetings if not meetings every six months.[65]

10. According to her, unless these existing institutions function effectively
and efficiently or are made to function effectively and efficiently, it is very
unlikely that any meaningful progress will be made in the family planning
program of the Government of India, of which sterilization is an important
component.[66]

11. With regard to the Family Planning Indemnity Scheme, it is pointed out
that regular reviews are not carried out; the utilization of funds made
available under the     Scheme are mere figures since the details of
disbursements in case of death, failure, complication etc. are simply not
available anywhere. There is no indication of the number of claims filed, the
number of claims rejected and the reasons for the rejection and the amount
provided to each successful claimant. The Scheme requires a death audit to be
carried out but that is more or less missing in every instance. It is stated that
specialists who are conversant with the Scheme are not available at
sterilization camps and health centres to explain the Scheme in detail so that




     08-08-2022 (Page 5 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitythere is no difficulty or complication faced in the event of an unfortunate
mishap. It should be the duty of such a specialist to ensure that each person
proceeding to undergo a sterilization procedure has a copy of all the required
documents so that there is no difficultly faced later on. This will also ensure
that each person gives an informed consent to the sterilization procedure in a
language that he or she understands. In fact, all information that is
disseminated with regard to the sterilization procedure should be made
available in the local language at all Government health facilities and
accredited private facilities.[67]

12. It is high time, according to Devika Biswas, for the Government of India to
look at the quality of care made available to persons post a sterilization
procedure. As is clear from various documents on record including the Ms.
Anita Jha Commission Report, after-care facilities in terms of counseling,
assistance, follow-up etc. are totally absent.[68]

13. The fundamental error that the Union of India is making (and it has
repeated   that  in   its affidavits)  is  by  asserting   that  the   effective
implementation of the sterilization program is the concern of each State since
it is a "Public health" issue covered by Entry 6 of List II in the Seventh
Schedule (the State List) of the Constitution. Apart from the fact that the
various entries in the Seventh Schedule relate to legislative power, the error
made by the Union of India is in completely overlooking the more appropriate
and Family Planning". This was inserted by the Constitution (Forty-second)l
Amendment Act, 1976. If the sterilization program is intended for population
control and family planning (which it undoubtedly is) there is no earthly
reason why the Union of India should refer to and rely on Entry 6 of the State
List and ignore Entry 20A of the Concurrent List.[69]

14. Population control and family planning has been and is a national
campaign over the last so many decades. Therefore, the responsibility for the
success or failure of the population control and family planning program (of
which sterilization procedure is an integral part) must rest squarely on the
shoulders of the Union of India. It is for this reason that the Union of India
has been taking so much interest in promoting it and has spent huge amounts
over the years in encouraging it. It is rather unfortunate that the Union of
India is now treating the sterilization program as a Public Health issue and
making it the concern of the State Government. This is simply not permissible
and appears to be a case of passing the buck.[69]

15. When the Union of India formulates schemes of national importance such
as family planning, their implementation is undoubtedly dependent on the
State Governments since they have the requisite mechanism for implementing
the schemes and can also take into account the needs that are particular to
the State and its people. In this manner, the cooperation of the Union of India
and all State Governments is indispensable to the success of such national
programs. Adverting to the provisions of the Constitution that allow for such
coordination between the Union and States, the Justice Sarkaria Commission
held that these provisions are not repugnant to but instead further the
principle of federalism.[71]





     08-08-2022 (Page 6 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global University16. In the same manner, it is imperative for both the Union of India and the
State Governments to implement schemes announced by the Union of India in
a manner that respects the fundamental rights of the beneficiaries of the
scheme. Given the structure of cooperative federalism, the Union of India
cannot confine its obligation to mere enactment of a scheme without
ensuring its realization and implementation.[72]

17. Apart from anything else, by not giving the sterilization program the
importance it deserves (apart from other methods of population control and
family planning) and trying to pass the buck to the State Governments, the
Union of India is attempting to find an excuse for failure in its duty of
effectively monitoring a program of national importance. This game of passing
the parcel and treating a national program as a public health issue has to stop
and somebody must take ownership of the Population Control and Family
Planning program.[73]

18. To compound the problem, and it is much more than a pity, our country
does not seem to have any health policy. The draft of a National Health Policy,
2015 was put up on the website on the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare
of the Government of India in December 2014 for comments, suggestions and
feedback but even after more than one and a half years, the website of the
said Ministry shows that the National Health Policy has not been finalized.
[74]
19. The draft National Health Policy states that its primary aim is to
"...inform, clarify, strengthen and prioritize the role of the Government in
shaping health system in all its dimensions..." The draft recognizes the
correlation between health and development and also recognizes the high
inequity in access to health care.[75]

20. With respect to sterilization, it states that sterilization related deaths are
a direct consequence of poor health care quality and is a preventable tragedy.
It also recognizes that female sterilizations are safest if performed in an
operation theatre which is functional throughout the year and by a
professional team with support systems which are in constant use. Camp
mode for such operations itself becomes a reason for unsatisfactory quality.
More monetary and human resource investment is required for the National
Rural Health Mission.[76]

21. Increase in the proportion of male sterilization in the total sterilizations
from the existing 5% to at least 30% is stated to be another policy
imperative under the health policy. Coercive methods are not justified and are
not even effective in meeting the goals of population control. Improved
access, education and empowerment should be the aim.[77]

22. A perusal of the various affidavits on record indicates that the sterilization
program is virtually a relentless campaign for female sterilization. This is
more or less confirmed from the figures available on the website of the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India. The issue
of male versus female sterilizations was debated and discussed during the
course of the hearings and it was conceded by all the learned Counsel that
the sterilization program cannot be targeted primarily towards women but




     08-08-2022 (Page 7 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitymust also actively include the sterilization of men as well. It appears to the
Court, without going into the merits and demerits of the incentives given for
undergoing the sterilization procedure, the documents on record indicate that
the incentive given to males for undergoing a sterilization procedure is less
than it is for females and that may perhaps be one of the reasons why the
percentage of males being sterilized is so remarkably low as compared to
females. This is an area that the Union of India must address itself to, if
nothing else then at least for reasons of gender equity.[79] and[80]

23. The manner in which sterilization procedures have reportedly been carried
out endanger two important components of the right to life Under Article 21
of the Constitution-the right to health and the reproductive rights of a person.
[81]

24. It is well established that the right to life Under Article 21 of the
Constitution includes the right to lead a dignified and meaningful life and the
right to health is an integral facet of this right. In C.E.S.C. Limited and Ors. v.
Subhash Chandra Bose and Ors. dealing with the right to health of workers, it
was noted that the right to health must be considered an aspect of social
justice informed by not only Article 21 of the Constitution, but also the
Directive Principles of State Policy and international covenants to which India
is a party. Similarly, the bare minimum obligations of the State to ensure the
preservation of the right to life and health were enunciated in Paschim Banga
Khet Mazdoor Samity v. State of W.B.[82]
25. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India and Ors. this Court underlined
the obligation of the State to ensure that the fundamental rights of weaker
Sections of society are not exploited owing to their position in society. That
the right to health is an integral part of the right to life does not need any
repetition.[83] and[84]

26. Over time, there has been recognition of the need to respect and protect
the reproductive rights and reproductive health of a person. Reproductive
health has been defined as "the capability to reproduce and the freedom to
make informed, free and responsible decisions. It also includes access to a
range of reproductive health information, goods, facilities and services to
enable individuals to make informed, free and responsible decisions about
their reproductive behaviour." The Committee on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights in General Comment No. 22 on the Right to Sexual and
Reproductive Health Under Article 12 of the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights observed that "The right to sexual and
reproductive health is an integral part of the right of everyone to the highest
attainable physical and mental health."[85]

27. This Court recognized reproductive rights as an aspect of personal liberty
Under Article 21 of the Constitution in Suchita Srivastava v. Chandigarh
Administration. The freedom to exercise these reproductive rights would
include the right to make a choice regarding sterilization on the basis of
informed consent and free from any form of coercion. The issue of informed
consent in respect of sterilization programs was considered by the Committee
on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women in A.S. v. Hungary, where
the Committee found Hungary to have violated Articles 10(h), 12 and 16,




     08-08-2022 (Page 8 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universityparagraph 1(e) of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against
Women by performing a sterilization operation on A.S. while she was brought
in for a caesarean by making her sign a consent form that she did not fully
understand. The Committee found that it was not plausible to hold that, in
the brief period of 17 minutes commencing from her admission in the hospital
to the completion of the surgical procedures, that the hospital personnel
provided her with sufficient counselling and information about sterilization,
as well as alternatives, risks and benefits, to ensure that she could make a
well-considered and voluntary decision to be sterilized.[86]

28. It is necessary to re-consider the impact that policies such as the setting
of informal targets and provision of incentives by the Government can have on
the reproductive freedoms of the most vulnerable groups of society whose
economic and social conditions leave them with no meaningful choice in the
matter and also render them the easiest targets of coercion. The cases of
Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samity and Bandhua Mukti Morcha have
emphasized that the State's obligation in respect of fundamental rights must
extend to ensuring that the rights of the weaker Sections of the community
are not exploited by virtue of their position. Thus, the policies of the
Government must not mirror the systemic discrimination prevalent in society
but must be aimed at remedying this discrimination and ensuring substantive
equality. In this regard, it is necessary that the policies and incentive
schemes are made gender neutral and the unnecessary focus on female
sterilization is discontinued.[87]
29. On the basis of the submissions before it, the Court has highlighted some
key issues that need active consideration. In addition, Court's attention was
repeatedly drawn to the guidelines given by this Court in Ramakant Rai (I)
and while it is generally the case of the Union of India and all the States that
the guidelines are being followed, the Court found that at least in respect of
some of them, there is still much more that needs to be done for their
effective implementation not only in letter but also in spirit. Some fine-tuning
is also necessary in view of the passage of time, change in circumstances and
the need to use technology to the optimum. Accordingly, the Court found it
necessary to issue the following supplementary directions:[88]

(1) The State-wise, district-wise or region-wise panel of doctors approved for
carrying out the sterilization procedure, must be accessible through the
website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of
India as well the corresponding Ministry or Department of each State
Government and each Union Territory. The list should contain all necessary
particulars of each doctor and not merely the name and designation. This
exercise should be completed on or before 31st December, 2016 and
thereafter the list be updated every quarter that is by 31st March, 30th June,
30th September and 31st December of every year.

(2) The contents of the checklist prepared pursuant to the directions given in
Ramakant Rai (I) should be explained to the proposed patient in a language
that he or she understands and the proposed patient should also be explained
the impact and consequences of the sterilization procedure. This can be
achieved by (a) ensuring that the checklist is in the local language of the
State; (b) it should contain a certificate duly signed by the concerned doctor




     08-08-2022 (Page 9 of 37) www.manupatra.com       OP Jindal Global Universitythat the proposed patient has been explained the contents of the checklist
and has understood its contents as well as the impact and consequences of
the sterilization procedure; (c) in addition to the certificate given by the
doctor, the checklist must also contain a certificate given by a trained
counselor (who may or may not be an ASHA worker) to the same effect as the
certificate given by the doctor. This will ensure that the proposed patient has
given an informed consent for undergoing the sterilization procedure and not
an incentivized consent.

Sufficient breathing time of about an hour or so should be given to a proposed
patient so that in the event he or she has a second thought, time is available
for a change of mind.

The checklist prepared pursuant to the direction given in Ramakant Rai (I)
with the aforesaid modifications should be prepared in the local or regional
language on or before 31st December, 2016.

(3) The Quality Assurance Committee (QAC) as well as the District Quality
Assurance Committee (DQAC) has been set up in every State and District in
terms of the directions given in Ramakant Rai (I). However, it is only the
designation of its members that has been made available. The details and
necessary particulars of each member of the QAC and DQAC should be
accessible from the website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of
each State Government and each Union Territory on or before 31st December,f
2016 and thereafter updated every quarter.

(4) In addition to the six monthly reports required to be published by the QAC
containing of the number of persons sterilized as well as the number of
deaths or complications arising out of the sterilization procedure, as already
directed in Ramakant Rai (I), the QAC must publish an Annual Report (on the
website of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of
India as well the corresponding Ministry or Department of each State
Government and each Union Territory) containing not only the statistical
information as earlier directed, but also non-statistical information in the
form of a report card indicating the meetings held, decisions taken, work done
and the achievements of the year etc. This will have a significant monitoring
and supervisory impact on the sterilization program and will also ensure the
active involvement of all the members of the QAC and the DQAC.

The first such Annual Report covering the calendar year 2016 should be
published on the websites mentioned above on or before 31st March, 2017.

(5) As many as 363 deaths have taken place due to sterilization procedures
during 2010-2013. This is a high figure. During this period, more than Rs. 50
crores have been disbursed towards compensation in cases of death. Apart
from steps taken by Bihar and Chhattisgarh during the pendency of the writ
petition to mitigate the sufferings of the patients, the Court has not been told
of any death audit conducted by any State Government or Union Territory in
respect of any patient, nor has it been informed of any steps taken against
any doctor or anybody else involved in the sterilization procedure that has
resulted in the death of a patient or any failure or any other complication




    08-08-2022 (Page 10 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityconnected with the sterilization procedure. There is a need for transparency
coupled with accountability and the death of a patient should not be treated
as a one-off aberration. Therefore, it is directed that the Annual Report
prepared by the QAC must indicate the details of all inquiries held and
remedial steps taken.

(6) With regard to the implementation of the Family Planning Indemnity
Scheme (FPIS), there does not seem to be any definitive information with
regard to the number of claims filed, the claims accepted and in which
category (death, failure, complication etc.), claims pending (and since when)
and claims rejected and the reasons for rejection. The QAC is directed to
include this information in the Annual Report and the Ministry of Health and
Family Welfare of the Government of India as well as the State Governments
should make this information accessible on the website, including the
quantum of compensation paid under each category and to the number of
persons.

The Court has mentioned above that the learned Solicitor General had assured
it on 20th March, 2015 that full details of the funds utilized under the FPIS
would be furnished but that information has not been given as yet,
necessitating the direction that it has passed.

In addition to the direction relating to the FPIS, the Ministry of Health and
Government of India have been utilized for the purpose for which they werehe
given for the period from 2013-14 onwards.

(7) The quantum of compensation fixed under the Family Planning Indemnity
Scheme (FPIS) deserves to be increased substantially and the burden thereof
must be equally shared by the Government of India and the State
Government. The State of Chhattisgarh has shown the way in this regard and
it would be appropriate if others follow the lead. Every death or failure or
complication related to the sterilization procedure is a set-back not only to
the patient and his or her family but also in the implementation of the
national campaign. The Court declined to fix the quantum of compensation
but would suggest, following the example of the State of Chhattisgarh, that
the amount should be doubled and shared equally.

(8) The Union of India is directed to persuade the State Governments to halt
the system of holding sterilization camps as has been done by at least four
States across the country. In any event, the Union of India should adhere to
its view that sterilization camps will be stopped within a period of three
years. In Court's opinion, this will necessitate simultaneous strengthening of
the Primary Health Care centres across the country both in terms of
infrastructure and otherwise so that health care is made available to all
persons. The significance of having well equipped Primary Health Centres
across the country certainly cannot be over-emphasized. Therefore, the Court
directed the Union of India to pay attention to this as well, since it is
absolutely important that all citizens of our country have access to primary
health care.

(9) The Union of India should make efforts to ensure that sterilization camps




    08-08-2022 (Page 11 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityare discontinued as early as possible but in any case within the time frame
already fixed and adverted to above. The Union of India and the State
Governments must simultaneously ensure that Primary Health Centres are
strengthened.

(10) Although the Union of India has stated that no targets have been fixed
for the implementation of the sterilization program, it appears that there is an
informal system of fixing targets. The Court left it to the good sense of the
each State Government and Union Territory to ensure that such targets are
not fixed so that health workers and others do not compel persons to undergo
what would amount to a forced or non-consensual sterilization merely to
achieve the target.

(11) The decisions taken in the high level meetings held on 15th May 2015
and 17th November 2015 as well as the National Summit on Family Planning
held on 5th and 6th April 2016 should be scrupulously implemented by the
Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of the Government of India. The said
Ministry should also ensure effective implementation of the decisions taken
keeping in mind that the sterilization program is a part of a national
campaign.

(12) The Union of India is directed to ensure strict adherence to the
guidelines and standard operating procedures in the various manuals issued
campaign for Population Control and Family Planning. The Union of India hastional
overarching responsibility for the success of the campaign and it cannot shift
the burden of implementation entirely on the State Governments and Union
Territories on the ground that it is only a public health issue. As the Justice
Sarkaria Commission put it "Population Control and Family Planning is a
matter of national importance and of common concern of the Union and the
States."

(13) The Court is pained to note the extremely casual manner in which some
of the States have responded to this public interest petition. What stands out
is the response of the States of Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and
Kerala in respect of which States allegations were made concerning
mismanagement in at least one sterilization camp. None of these States have
given any acceptable response to the allegations and the Court had no option
but to assume that the camps that have been referred to in the writ petition
were mismanaged as alleged by Devika Biswas. However, the matter should
not end here. The Court directed the Registry of this Court to transmit a copy
of this judgment to the Registrar General of the High Court in the States of
Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Kerala for being placed before
the Chief Justice of the High Court. The Court requested the Chief Justice to
initiate a suo moto public interest petition to consider the allegations made
by Devika Biswas in respect of the sterilization camp(s) held in these States
(the allegations not having been specifically denied) and any other similar
laxity or unfortunate mishap that might be brought to the notice of the Court
and pass appropriate orders thereon. The Court also directed the Registry of
this Court to transmit a copy of this judgment to the Registrar General of the
Patna High Court for being placed before the Chief Justice of the High Court.
The Court requested the Chief Justice to ensure speedy completion of the




    08-08-2022 (Page 12 of 37) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universityinvestigations and proceedings relating to the mishap on 7th January 2012 in
the sterilization camp in Kaparfora Government Middle School, Kursakanta,
Araria district as well as the mishap in Chhapra in Saran district that led to
cancellation of the accreditation of Gunjan Maternity and Surgical Clinic on
24th March 2012.

(14) The State of Chhattisgarh is directed to implement the recommendations
given in the Ms. Anita Jha Report at the earliest and with all sincerity.

(15) The Court has already expressed its sadness at the fact that the National
Health Policy has not yet been finalized despite the passage of more than one
and a half years. The Court directed the Union of India to take a decision on
or before 31st December, 2016 on whether it would like to frame a National
Health Policy or not. In case the Union of India thinks it worthwhile to have a
National Health Policy, it should take steps to announce it at the earliest and
keep issues of gender equity in mind as well.

30. With the above supplementary directions, the writ petition is disposed of.
The Court recorded its appreciation for the efforts put in by Devika Biswas in
bringing this vital issue to the notice of this Court and to all the learned
Counsel and concerned officers of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of
the Government of India in not treating the public interest litigation as an
adversarial proceeding but as a collaborative effort to find a remedy to some
problems and improve the well being of the citizens of the country. [89]

negligence against respondents -- National Commission justified in dismissing

While deciding whether the medical professional is guilty of medical
negligence following well known principles must be kept in viewÂ :

(I) Negligence is the breach of a duty exercised by omission to do something
which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations which ordinarily
regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something which a
prudent and reasonable man would not do.

(II) Negligence is an essential ingredient of the offence. The negligence to be
established by the prosecution must be culpable or gross and not the
negligence merely based upon an error of judgment.

(III) The medical professional is expected to bring a reasonable degree of
skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither
the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence judged in the
light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law requires.

(IV) A medical practitioner would be liable only where his conduct fell below
that of the standards of a reasonably competent practitioner in his field.

(V) In the realm of diagnosis and treatment there is scope for genuine




     08-08-2022 (Page 1 of 21) www.manupatra.com        OP Jindal Global Universitydifference of opinion and one professional doctor is clearly not negligent
merely because his conclusion differs from that of other professional doctor.

(VI) The medical professional is often called upon to adopt a procedure which
involves higher element of risk, but which he honestly believes as providing
greater chances of success for the patient rather than a procedure involving
lesser risk but higher chances of failure. Just because a professional looking
to the gravity of illness has taken higher element of risk to redeem the
patient out of his/her suffering which did not yield the desired result may not
amount to negligence.

(VII) Negligence cannot be attributed to a doctor so long as he performs his
duties with reasonable skill and competence. Merely because the doctor
chooses one course of action in preference to the other one available, he
would not be liable if the course of action chosen by him was acceptable to
the medical profession.

(VIII) It would not be conducive to the efficiency of the medical profession if
no Doctor could administer medicine without a halter round his neck.

(IX) It is our bounden duty and obligation of the civil society to ensure that
the medical professionals are not unnecessarily harassed or humiliated so
that   they  can   perform   their   professional  duties   without   fear  and
apprehension.
(X) The medical practitioners at times also have to be saved from such a class
of complainants who use criminal process as a tool for pressurizing the
medical professionals / hospitals particularly private hospitals or clinics for
extracting uncalled for compensation. Such malicious proceedings deserve to
be discarded against the medical practitioners.

(XI) The medical professionals are entitled to get protection so long as they
perform their duties with reasonable skill and competence and in the interest
of the patients. The interest and welfare of the patients have to be paramount
for the medical professionals.

As long as the doctors have performed their duties and exercised an ordinary
degree of professional skill and competence, they cannot be held guilty of
medical negligence. It is imperative that the doctors must be able to perform
their professional duties with free mind.

Ratio Decidendi:
"Doctors performing their duties and exercise an ordinary degree of
professional skill and competence cannot be held guilty of negligence."

publication seeking kidney from willing altruistic donors--Publication cannot
be permitted as it may lead to financial arrangements between the donor and
the donee.

Petitioners are persons who are affected by renal complaints and need kidney
transplantation. They seek permission of court to take out publication in print
media seeking a Kidney from willing altruistic donors. High Court had granted
permission to take out such publication on a case to case basis. Government
contended that though the publication may not have an indication explicitly;
it could lead to a payment arrangement, which is prohibited by law. It was
also pointed out that once publication is permitted there is no safeguard in
place to prohibit commercial dealings in human organs and tissues. On a
detailed  examination    of  the   procedure   involved  for  making    kidney
transplantation and after hearing all the stakeholders, the learned Single
Judge held that publication cannot be permitted as it may lead to financial
arrangements between the donor and the donee. Petitioners were directed to
seeking organ donation from unrelated persons. Disposing of the writd of
petitions;

Held:

This Court is of the opinion that any publication permitted could lead to
negotiations and merely because        there   is no explicit   offer in   the

The petitioners, the husband and wife, have moved this petition under Article 32 of the
Constitution with manifold prayers. In the course of hearing, Mr. Colin Gonsalves,
learned senior counsel appearing for the petitioners, has restricted his argument to
prayer (g) which pertains to issue of direction for constituting a medical board to assess
the pregnancy of the 1 st petitioner and direct for termination of the pregnancy.
When the matter was listed on 21.6.2017, the Court took note of the prayer for
appointment of a panel of doctors at a Government hospital in Kolkata to examine the
state of health of the mother and accordingly directed the matter to be listed on
23.6.2017.

When the matter was listed on 23.6.2017, this Court had passed the following order :-
In pursuance of the previous order of this Court Å“dated 21.06.2017,learned standing
counsel appearing on behalf of the State of West Bengal has placed on the record his
instructions indicating that a team of senior Doctors may be constituted to evaluate the
mental and physical health of the first petitioner and the state of health of the foetus. At
this stage, the pregnancy is in its 25th week.

 2 The court has been apprised of the medical reports produced on record by the
petitioners, including the opinion of Doctor Devi Shetty, which is annexed to the paper
book. We accordingly constitute a Medical Board consisting of the following Doctors to
examine the first petitioner and her foetus at the Institute of Post Graduate Medical

constituted and a report was submitted before this Court on 29.6.2017. Thereafter, the
matter was directd to be listed today.

It is submitted by Mr. Colin Gonsalves, learned senior counsel appearing for the
petitioners that the medical report clearly stipulates the condition of the 1st petitioner
and if the report is appositely appreciated, the direction, as prayed for, deserves to be

Finally in pursuance of the Notice of the Director, IPGMER, Kolkata vide Memo N.

27th June, 2017 in the Office Chamber of Dr. S.C. Biswas, Professor of the Department
of Gynae & Obst, IPGMER-SSKM Hospital, in presence of all members of the constituted

Acchyut Sarkar, Department of Cardiology was absent. He deputed Dr. Saroj Mondal,
Kolkata The patient, 1st Petitioner of the case Mrs.iologist, IPGMER-SSKM Hospital,

Sarmisth Chakrabortty, 33 years old, w/o Mr.

Anirban Chakrabortty was examined by the Board Members and all the members
expressed their views. Two Gynaecologists, (1) Professor Subhash Chandra Biswas &
(2) Professor Arati Biswas, on good faith examined the patient physically and observed
the following findings: Her L.M.P.-27.12.2016 E.D.D.-4.10.2017 & she is G2Po+1+0+0
Previous pregnancy- she had sudden bleeding P/V & pain abdomen at approximately
seven and half months and delivered in Appolo Hospital, Kolkata, a still born baby
vaginally (as per previous records) in 2015.

On examination- She is conscious and co-operative with profound mental agony.
Her Vitals-stable Per abdominal examination reveals

1. Fundal height of gravid uterus- 24 weeks+ (approx 26 weeks) (Corresponding to
period of amennaorhoea)

2. Liqour-adequate (as per period of gestation)

3. Fetal parts-Palpable
4. F.H.S.+ & Regular Patient, herself spontaneously expressed her wish not to continue
this pregnancy in view of the detected fetal cardiac anomalies so far. On reviewing of
the available records of the patient i.e. U.S.G., Fetal Echo-Cardiography including the
prescription of the attending Obstetrician in Apollo Hospital, Kolkata, the other members
of the Board (Radiologist, Cardiologist, Neonatologist, Pediatric Surgeon and Cardiac
Surgeon) have opined that Å“the fetus has been 7 detected to have cardiac
malformation in the form of Tetralogy of Fallot, Large perimembranous VSD with inlet
extension (bidirectional flow), Aorta from LV overriding the VSD, Pulmonary Atresia,
Duct / MAPCA dependent pulmonary circulation andGood Ventricular function. The
child, if born alive, need complex cardiac corrective surgery stage by stage after birth.
But there is high mortality and borbidity at every step of this staged surgeriesÂ. The
cardiac anomaly has been confirmed by serial investigations.

In view of the above facts and opinion, we, the two Gynaecologists, in good faith like to
opine that the patient is at the threat of severe mentl injury, if the pregnancy is
continued.

Therefore, if the patient wants termination of this pregnancy, she may be allowed with
prior informed consent of inherent risk of her health for procedural inventions, because
there is additional risk of termination of the pregnancy once it is beyond 20 weeks as
the present case is. However, this is a special case and conclusion has been drawn on



      08-08-2022 (Page 3 of 5)     www.manupatra.com          OP Jindal Global Universityits individual merits.Â On a perusal of the aforesaid report, it is clear as crystal that the
Medical Board is of the view that it is a case for termination of pregnancy, as a special
case. As the last paragraph would show, the Board has mentioned that the patient is at
the threat of severe mental injury, if the pregnancy is continued. It has also opined that
the child, if born alive, needs complex cardiac corrective surgery stage by stage after
birth. But there is high mortality and borbidity at every step of this staged surgeries.

Mr. Gonsalves, learned senior counsel has drawn our attention to two orders, one
passed in Meera Santosh Pal & Ors. vs. Union ofIndia & Ors. [WP (C) No. 17 of 2017
decided on 16.1.2017], wherein this Court, after considering the report of the Medical
Board, has held thus :- Å“Upon evaluation of petitioner no.1, the aforesaid Medical
Board has concluded that her current pregnancy is of about 24 weeks. The condition of
the fetus is not compatible with extra-uterine life. In other words, the fetus would not
be able to survive outside the uterus.
Importantly, it is reported that the continuation of pregnancy can gravely endanger the
physical and mental health of petitioner no.1 and the risk of her termination of
pregnancy is within acceptable limits with institutional back up.Â Learned senior
counsel has also drawn our attention to another order passed in Mrs. X & Ors. vs. Union
of India & Ors. [WP (C)No.81 of 2017 decided on 7.3.2017] wherein this Court had
allowed the termination of pregnancy. The Court had taken the Medical report into
consideration which was to the following effect : Å“There is thus a clear diagnosis of
the condition of the single live fetus which is said to have bialateral renal agenesis
wheich means the fetus has no kidneys and anhydramnios which means that there is an
absence of amniotic fluid in the womb. Further, there is a clear observation that there is
a risk of intrauterine fetal death, i.e. death within womb and there is no chance of a
long term post natal survival.

What is important is that there is no curative treatment available at present for bilateral
renal agenesis.

The Medical Board has opined that thecondition of the fetus is incompatible with extra-
uterine life, i.e. outside the womb because prolonged absence of amniotic fluid results
in pulmonary hypoplasia leading to severe 4 respiratory insufficiency at birth.
From the point of view of the petitioner the report has observed risk to the mother since
continuation of pregnancy can endanger her physical and mental health.

Mr. A.K. Panda, learned senior counsel appearing for the Union of India has drawn our
attention to two other orders, one passed in Savita Sachin Patil & Ors. vs. Union of
India and Ors. [WP (C)No.121 of 2017 decided on 28.02.2017] and another in Sheetal
Shankar Salvi & Anr. vs. Union of India & Ors. [W.P. No.174 of 2017 decided on
27.3.2017]. In the case of Savita Sachin Patil, theCourt declined to grant permission by
holding, thus : Å“As regards the prognosis, the said medical report clearly does not and
possibly cannot, observe that this particular fetus will have severe mental and physical
challenges. It states that the Å“baby is likely to have mental and physical challenges.Â
In the earlier part of the said medical report, there is no observation made by the
aforestated Medical Board that every baby with Down Syndromehas low intelligence,
but it was observed that Å“intelligence among people with Down Syndrome is variable
and a large proportion may have an intelligence Quotient of less than 50 (severe mental
retardation)Â.
In any case, it is not possible to discern the danger to the life of petitioner no.1 in case
she is not allowed to terminate her pregnancy.




      08-08-2022 (Page 4 of 5)     www.manupatra.com           OP Jindal Global UniversityIn the facts and circumstances of the case, it is not possible for us to grant permission
to petitioner no.1 to terminate the life of the fetus.

In view of the above, as it presently advised, we decline the prayer (a) of the
petitioners for directing the respondents to allow Petitioner No.1 to undergo medical
termination of the pregnancy.Â In Sheetal Shankar Salvi, after perusing the report, the
Court observed that there is no danger to mother's life and the liklihood that the baby
may be born alive and survive for variable period of time, and, therefore, it would not
be appropriate to allow the petitioner No.1 to undergo medical termination of her
pregnancy.
The orders which have been referred to by Mr. Panda, in our considered opinion, rest on
their own facts. Frankly speaking, cases of this nature have to rest on their own facts
because it shall depend upon the nature of the report of the Medical Board and also the
requisite consent as engrafted under the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971.

In the instant case, as the report of the Medical Board, whichwe have produced, in
entirety, clearly reveals that the mother shall suffer mental injury if the pregnancy is
continued and there will be multiple problems if the child is born alive. That apart, the
Medical Board has categorically arrived at a conclusion thatthe in a special case of this
nature, the pregnancy should be allowed to be terminated after 20 weeks.

In the case of Suchita Srivastava & Anr. vs. Chandigarh Administration [(2009) 9 SCC
1), the Court has expressed the view that the right of a woman to have reproductive
choice is an insegregable part of her personal liberty, as envisaged under Article 21 of
the Constitution. She has a sacrosanct right to have her bodily integrity. The case at
hand, as we find, unless the pregnancy is allowed to be terminated, the life of the
mother as well as that of the baby to be born will be in great danger. Such a situation
cannot be countenanced in Court.
Regard being had to the aforesaid and keeping in view the report of the Medical Board,
we are inclined to allow the prayer and direct medical termination of pregnancy of the
1st petitioner at the IPGMER-SSKM Hospital.The termination procedure to be carried
out forthwith by the competent authorities of the IPGMER-SSKM Kolkata. For the sake of
clarity, we may hasten to add that Mr. Gonsalves, upon obtaining instructions, has
agreed for the said hospital. When we say, 'carried out forthwith' it depends when the
1st petitioner and her husband go to the hospital, it shall be conducted without any
delay.

Accordingly, the Writ Petition is disposed of.
